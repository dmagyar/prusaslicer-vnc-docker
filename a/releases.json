Among other things, the release adds support for Klipper firmware flavor, extends capabilities of custom G-codes, improves Arrange function, enhances Export to STL to subtract negative meshes, and fixes bugs found in previous alphas. For the full list of new features in the 2.6.0 series, please read the release logs of [2.6.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha2), [2.6.0-alpha3](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha3), [2.6.0-alpha4](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha4) and [2.6.0-alpha5](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha5).\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into the PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Klipper firmware support #3452\r\nWhile it has been technically possible to use PrusaSlicer with printers running Klipper even in previous versions, it required the printer profile to be properly set and the settings were not intuitive. To make the configuration easier:\r\n- There is now an extra G-code flavor for Klipper (`Printer Settings->General->Firmware flavor`)\r\n- The machine limits table is shown to allow more precise time estimates, but no values from the Machine limits table are emitted into the G-code when Klipper is selected\r\n- The automatic insertion of temperature commands at the beginning of the G-code is now optional and is controlled by a new configuration checkbox named \"Autoemit temperature commands\". If you are using macros in your Start G-code to set temperatures, you might want to turn this off. It is enabled by default to maintain backwards compatibility. #2420, #6847, #10018\r\n- Acceleration can be set separately for travel moves\r\n- There is a new print host named `Mainsail/Fluidd`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Placeholder parser improvements\r\nThe macro language that is used to process Custom G-codes got several significant improvements, namely:\r\n- Added support for local and global variables #4048 #7196\r\n- Support for \"writable\" variables, that can be used to pass changes of state (such as position or retraction) that a custom G-code performed back to PrusaSlicer so it knows to compensate.\r\n- `one_of()` function to match an argument to any of the given patterns\r\n- `interpolate_table()` function, which interpolates a piecewise linear function at point `x`\r\n- `size()` and `empty()` functions to return the state of any vector variable\r\n- New and simplified syntax for `if-elsif-else` blocks\r\n- Added vector placeholders `extruded_volume`, `extruded_weight`, `extruded_volume_total` and `extruded_weight_total` to give current consumption of the material for individual extruders\r\n\r\nThe changes are described in more detail in the [respective wiki page](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/wiki/PrusaSlicer-Macro-Language).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to 2.6.0-alpha5\r\n- 'Arrange' and 'Fill bed with instances' functions now take into account skirt and brim separation (#3072, #3477, #5286, #5310, #9301, #9309). Many thanks to @jschuh (#7653) and @individ-divided (#9181), whose pull requests were very useful sources of inspiration, despite not being used verbatim.\r\n- The 'Export as STL/OBJ' function is now able to subtract negative meshes. Note that the algorithm may fail on non-manifold geometries (e.g., those containing self-intersection, etc). In that case, the user is notified, and only positive volumes are exported. #9798 #7594 #8853\r\n- The configuration option `Only infill when needed` was removed. It never worked well, and it was a frequent source of confusion and bug reports when it removed infill from places where it was desirable or vice versa (#9790, #8381, #7914, #6286, #5791, #4916, #2796). The option is superseded by Lightning infill (#8648) and the feature has become too much of a maintenance burden, leading to problems when implementing new features #9935.\r\n- The 'Purging volumes' settings accessible by a button in the right panel is now only shown and used for single-extruder multi material printers. Setting purging volumes based on which filament is unloaded does not make sense for proper multi-extruder systems, which can easily control the required purging in `Filament Settings->Advanced->Minimal purge on the wipe tower`. Note that this is potentially a breaking change, affecting non-single MM profiles with the 'Purging volumes' set much higher than the value in filament settings, in which case the wipe tower will become smaller than it was in previous PrusaSlicer versions.\r\n- The wipe tower can optionally be printed with a \"stabilization cone\", which prevents it from toppling over. The apex angle of the cone is adjustable in `Print Settings->Multiple Extruders->Wipe tower`. Setting the value to zero disables the cone.\r\n- The spacing of purging lines on the wipe tower can be increased using another new configuration option in `Print Settings->Multiple Extruders->Wipe tower`\r\n- The size of the wipe tower preview block the 3D scene should now be more precisely estimated\r\n- When switching to 3D scene after slicing in SLA mode, the pad and support trees are now shown as they were in 2.5.x. This functionality was temporarily removed in 2.6.0-alpha2 because of issues it caused when using negative meshes (which was not possible in 2.5.x).\r\n- Print bed reference axes are now automatically downscaled when zoomed in #9483\r\n- The pointy ends of 'Frustum'-type connectors produced by the Cut tool are now slightly trimmed\r\n- When an edge is selected in the Measurement tool, its length is shown in the measurement dialog\r\n- It is now possible to set separate acceleration for travel moves in `Print Settings->Speed->Acceleration control`. The value is clamped by the maximum travel acceleration in `Printer Settings->Machine limits` when using Marlin 2 or RepRapFirmware flavor.\r\n- The `M107` (turn fan off) command emitted at the beginning of the G-code was removed\r\n- For a long time, PrusaSlicer would scan the Start G-code and insert temperature-setting commands when they were not present. This feature is now optional and is controlled by a new configuration checkbox named \"Autoemit temperature commands\".\r\n- 'Save/Rename Preset' dialog was simplified when only one preset is being saved/renamed.\r\n- Organic supports: reduced default `support_tree_top_rate` to 15%\r\n- Estimated print time for the first layer was added as a comment at the end of the G-code, supplementing similar information already available\r\n- The text tool behaves better when positioning text on an object with multiple instances\r\n- The text tool now has a lock switch next to 'Rotation' field in the Advanced controls. This allows to unlock the free rotation. It is for dragging text over the surface without orientation jump.\r\n- Constrained scaling (scaling using the scale tool while pressing the CTRL key) can now be used with any selection\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.6.0-alpha5\r\n- The reference axes at the origin were incorrectly rendered on top of objects when viewed from the bottom of the bed\r\n- Filament type dropdown did not accept user editable text #9770\r\n- Extra perimeters on overhangs were printed in the air when the external perimeters option was enabled #9545\r\n- The cut tool did not place the pins and holes correctly when used on an object with scaling applied #9991, #10010, #10056, #10096, #10126\r\n- Export STL did not export anything when the file extension entered in the Save dialog was not lowercase #10000\r\n- Fixed a hang in rare cases when calculating Organic supports #10048\r\n- The new bridging algorithm that extends bridge infill over sparse infill now works with Adaptive Cubic and Adaptive Support infill types. The only infill type that is not yet supported is Lightning infill.\r\n- The bridge angle setting was incorrectly interpreted as if it was in radians instead of degrees #9963 \r\n- Fixed an incorrect bridging angle in some cases #10086, #9895\r\n- The new bridging algorithm generated overextrusions when 'Thick bridges' were enabled #10073\r\n- The new bridging algorithm was extremely slow in certain cases #10049\r\n- The new bridging algorithm sometimes extended the bridging extrusions too much (mentioned in https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/9245#issuecomment-1456764409)\r\n- When 'Disable fan for first N layers' was enabled, the 'Fan speed on overhangs' feature did not work correctly (#9975, thanks @jschuh)\r\n- Fixed a false positive warning about stability issues, sometimes appearing on simple models with straight walls #9744\r\n- Fixed a crash when using add instance function with the wipe tower selected\r\n- Several layout issues were fixed #9768\r\n- It was not possible to export multi-extruder config when some filaments had `idle_temperature` checked and others did not #10163\r\n- Fixed an error sometimes reported when slicing in SLA mode\r\n- macOS specific: Fixed a crash in the text embossing tool when moving a text with on an object partially below the bed\r\n- Fixed incorrect selection in Object list when moving a part of an object below the bed (or from below the bed)\r\n- Fixed a bug in Organic supports that caused the trees to cut through an object in some cases\r\n- Fixed a hang in the Arachne perimeter generator with specific geometries #10034\r\n- Improved eject function on Windows. Since our code added to 2.6.0-alpha2 is having issues with external SD card readers, we have added a detection of such devices (based on https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/main/usb/usbview). Detected external SD card readers are ejected using the code from 2.5.0 and older. We are aware that the older approach might eject devices too early and we are working on a fix.\r\n- When adding text to a scaled/mirrored object, the text is not created with the scale/mirror applied\r\n- Fixed the constrained scaling (scaling using scale tool while pressing CTRL key)\r\n- The reset button for skew is only shown when the world matrix contains it (the skewed object/volume is visible in the 3D scene)\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.5.0\r\n- 'Scale to fit' function was modified to avoid having the top layer exceed the print volume max height\r\n- When emitting `M204` command at the beginning of the G-code, the correct format (`M204 ST`) is now used for `Marlin (legacy)` firmware flavor (in previous versions, the new `M204 PRT` was used).\r\n- Incorrect parts were selected in some cases after 'Split to objects' was used #10072\r\n",

    "body": "# ![PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/raw/master/resources/icons/PrusaSlicer_128px.png)\r\n​\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n​This is the final release of PrusaSlicer 2.5.1, which is a minor release containing profiles for the Original Prusa XL printer and several related improvements over [2.5.0](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0).\r\n\r\nIt does NOT contain Organic supports, the improved Cut tool, and other features introduced in PrusaSlicer 2.6.x series. These are currently only available in 2.6.0 prerelease versions (the most recent currently being [2.6.0-alpha5](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha5)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.5.0\r\n- 'Monotonic lines' top/bottom fill pattern\r\nIt is very similar to Monotonic, except that adjacent lines are not connected. This allows for smaller perimeter/infill overlap and results in better filling of the top/bottom layer, less over-extrusion, and better dimensional accuracy.\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214859075-d250d4a8-e24c-443e-8af4-30a29e9b62db.png\" width=\"50%\" >\r\n\r\n- It is now possible to set acceleration separately for external perimeters, solid infill and top solid infill (`Print Settings->Speed->Acceleration control`)\r\n- Original Prusa XL specific: Arrangement into the corner\r\nThe Prusa XL printer has a segmented bed, and it is capable of heating just a part of it to lower power consumption. Because the most efficient way of doing this is to start heating at the corner, the Arrange function in PrusaSlicer can now be configured to prefer corners. The setting is available after right-clicking the Arrange icon in the top toolbar and defaults to \"Front Left\". Auto arrangement is forced when an object is added to an empty print bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.5.0\r\n- Fixed a crash sometimes occurring when slicing very detailed models https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/8834\r\n\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Added Original Prusa XL profiles\r\n\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n- Updated dictionaries for CS, DE, ES, FR, IT and PL\r\n",

It brings several substantial changes to the slicing core and fixes bugs found in previous alphas. For new features in the 2.6.0 series, please read the release logs of [2.6.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha2), [2.6.0-alpha3](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha3) and [2.6.0-alpha4](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha4).\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into the PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ensure vertical shell thickness improvement\r\n\r\nThis change improves one of the most hated feature of PrusaSlicer: too much solid infill and the way it is printed. Some of the related issues are #28, #223, #1054, #1531, #2137, #3744, #6853, #9245, #9898.\r\n\r\nThe problem and its history are as follows: When printing sloping surfaces, the resulting wall gets thinner (for obvious geometrical reasons). In the case that the slope is small, this effect can even produce holes in these walls, as the external perimeter on one layer may in fact be \"more inside\" than the innermost perimeter on the layer below. Original Slic3r applied rectilinear infill to fill in these gaps, PrusaSlicer added an extra logic to `Ensure vertical shell thickness`, which was trying to ensure that the shell would not be thinner than a vertical wall would be. The algorithm had the disadvantage of consuming more material than needed and creating very short segments of infill with abrupt changes of direction, leading to significant vibrations of the printer.\r\n\r\nStarting with this version, PrusaSlicer fills the areas with concentric infill. The calculation of the areas is also reworked, so the material is only added where it is really needed. The old \"Ensure vertical shell thickness\" parameter used to switch between the upstream Slic3r and Slic3r Prusa Edition algorithms to ensure vertical wall thickness. The new algorithm implemented in PrusaSlicer 2.6.0-alpha5 is significantly better than either of the two old algorithms; thus, the switch \"Ensure vertical shell thickness\" was removed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/222755595-7fad2b5e-8ec6-4536-96ea-373844b3a806.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Extend sparse infill #569\r\n\r\nAnother long-standing issue was connected to bridging solid infill printed over sparse infill. The shape of such infill islands was only determined by what was above, and the infill lines were often inadequately supported as a result, leading to mid-air extrusions and possibly failed prints. PrusaSlicer now extends the lines of the bridge infill so that their ends are supported by the sparse infill on the layer below. The bridge infill is now always using 'Thick bridges'. The new algorithm is NOT applied for Support Cubic, Adaptive Cubic and Lightning infill.\r\n\r\nThis change also made it possible to decrease the expansion of the bridging layers, which leads to smaller filament consumption and shorter print times. The comparison image below shows exactly the same model (a cube with a counterbored hole in the top face). Only the two adjacent layers are shown for clarity:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/222759165-ef2ffb25-3c17-45e3-b572-c87775fcc0a8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dynamic control of fan speed on overhangs #2921\r\n\r\nThis feature is similar to `Dynamic overhang speed` introduced in [2.6.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha2). Fan speed is defined for predefined overlaps, and PrusaSlicer interpolates between the values to set the optimal fan speed when printing overhangs. The feature is accessible in `Filament settings->Cooling->Dynamic fan speeds`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to 2.6.0-alpha4\r\n- It is now possible to import ZIP file contents from `File->Import->Import ZIP Archive`. A dedicated dialog is shown, and the user can select which of the files in the ZIP archive they want to open.\r\n- Organic supports can now be used with raft. Raft is built for the object only. Organic supports are routed directly to a print bed, they are not supported by a raft. #9816, #9743, #9526\r\n- Raft interface / contact layers are newly produced with alternating directions, and raft contact layer is newly perpendicular to a fill direction of the first object layer.\r\n- The configuration of `Dynamic overhang speed` was simplified, the percentage levels for which the speeds are set are fixed at 0/25/50/75 %.\r\n- There is a new `is_nil` function available in custom G-Codes to check whether a given configuration option is currently inactive (such as idle_temperature in Filament Settings). Example usage: `{if is_nil(idle_temperature[0])}...{else}...{endif}`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.6.0-alpha4\r\n- Wipe tower brim was not shown in the 3D scene after slicing was finished\r\n- Tool temperature visualization in Preview was incorrect in some cases (related to #8324 and #9597)\r\n- macOS specific: Text emboss input dialog did not allow pasting text from the clipboard #9795 \r\n- \"Avoid crossing curled overhangs\" sometimes generated travel moves outside of the bed #9800\r\n- Fixed \"Dynamic overhang speed\" when Pressure equalizer was used #9485\r\n- Fixed a crash in G-Code Viewer when parsing G-Code generated by Simplify3D #9823\r\n- G-Code Preview did not account for z offset when setting the height of the toolpaths for the purge line in custom start G-Code #9722\r\n- Fixed a crash when trying to add instances when multiple objects are selected #9864 \r\n- Various minor improvements and bugfixes in the Cut tool #9771\r\n- Fixed a bug that incorrectly triggered an \"out-of-bed\" error when specific transformation was applied. The same problem caused issues when changing variable layer height #9467 #9519 #9646\r\n- By pressing the 'T' keyboard shortcut, it was possible to add text to an object that was created by a cut and had connectors. This is now fixed, as this is an unsupported scenario.\r\n- Fixed a crash sometimes occurring on startup on macOS Ventura 13.2.1 #9774\r\n- Reload from disk was not available for 3MF files #9822\r\n- Fixed a crash when cutting an object containing a modifier\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.5.0\r\n- Fixed a crash happening after splitting a painted object into parts (related to all paint-on features). The painting is now removed before the splitting and the user is notified about it #9809\r\n- Fixed missing dense raft layers when number of support top interface layers was set to zero. Mentioned in #7951.\r\n- Fixed discrepancy between the G-code placeholder parser current layer index and the total number of layers. Fixed for non-sequential print only for now #9866\r\n\r\n\r\n## Localizations\r\n- Updated dictionaries for CS (currently incomplete), DE, ES, FR, IT and PL\r\n",

It mostly fixes bugs found in previous alphas, but there are also improvements, especially related to the Cut tool. For new features in the 2.6.0 series, please read the release logs of [2.6.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha2) and [2.6.0-alpha3](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha3).\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n## Cut Tool Improvements\r\n\r\n- The Cut tool dialog layout was changed to be easier to comprehend\r\n- Upper and lower part of the object are now highlighted in color\r\n- Added a possibility to cut the object into parts - in that case, connectors cannot be placed and the parts retain its position within the object. Thanks @jschuh for this idea (presented in #9564).\r\n- The controls of the tool obscured the object when it was small #9657\r\n- Added a functionality \"Flip cut plane\" to easily add pins to the other side of the plane #9632\r\n- The cut tool now works even when the cutting plane does not intersect any volume of the object, so the tool can be used to separate parts into multiple objects without actually cutting anything. This is the same behavior as in 2.5.0. #9629\r\n- When placing connectors in the new Cut tool, the tolerance is now entered in absolute values #9697\r\n- The cut plane is now highlighted on hover, it is newly possible to move it by dragging.\r\n- If the object is cut into parts or when it does not have any connectors, the \"lock\" of scaling of the resulting parts is not applied #9633\r\n- Performance improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to 2.6.0-alpha3\r\n\r\n- The option \"Clip multipart objects\" was removed. PrusaSlicer now always behaves as if it was ON. This option was a candidate for removal for a long time, and the new algorithms we implemented for the 2.6 series are no longer compatible with it. We believe that there is really no reason to not clip the objects and we have seen many cases where leaving it OFF accidentally led to unexpected results (overlapping extrusions) #9679, #8779, #3872\r\n- Increased sensitivity of the curled overhang avoidance algorithm\r\n- 'Set Number of Instances' now works when multiple objects are selected #6994\r\n- Organic supports are now consistently referred to as 'Organic'\r\n- Organic supports parameters are now grayed out when different style of supports is selected\r\n- It is newly possible to set acceleration separately for external perimeters, solid infill and top solid infill (`Print Settings->Speed->Acceleration control`)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.6.0-alpha3\r\n\r\n- Extra perimeters on overhangs sometimes overlapped with infill #9604\r\n- Fixed an occasional crash when using Organic supports with specific settings #9555\r\n- Fixed a crash during slicing when certain strings were present in custom G-codes. This was also a problem in previous versions, but instead of a crash, incorrect cooling logic might have been applied in these cases #9470, #9550\r\n- The \"Export plate as STL including supports\" option was grayed out in the menu when the object only had pad and no supports #9558\r\n- Organic supports: All contours are CCW oriented, inner contours are printed before outer contours.\r\n- Fixed crash in Organic supports with a single support layer only #9557\r\n- Linux specific: The new \"idle_temperature\" option in Filament Settings did not behave correctly when checked and unchecked (UI glitches).\r\n- Fixed a rare crash during slicing with specific geometries #9561, #9562\r\n- \"Verbose G-Code\" option produced invalid G-Code when \"Dynamic overhang speed\" was enabled #9588, #9610\r\n- Cooling slowdown was applied incorrectly when \"Dynamic overhang speed\" was enabled #9594, #9485\r\n- \"Dynamic overhang speed\" would set speed to zero if the speed was percentage based and external perimeter speed was set to 0 (auto). Thanks @MGunlogson for helpful investigation of this issue in #9622.\r\n- \"Dynamic overhang speed\" could violate (volumetric) speed limits #9709. Thanks @MGunlogson for helpful investigation of this issue in #9622.\r\n- \"Dynamic overhang speed\" did not work correctly with Pressure equalizer feature #9485, #9563.\r\n- The \"optional\" config option `idle_temperature` now retains its value when disabled and enabled again. If the value cannot be recovered (e.g. after switching to different tab), a value of 30 is used as a default instead of 1500. Previously, the value would change to 1500 (maximum allowed temperature) when the option was reenabled.

An extra dialog notifying about this is now shown on startup when the new version is first run.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to 2.6.0-alpha2\r\n\r\n- Downloader preferences options were crashing in G-Code Viewer #9496\r\n- Cut function did not correctly apply tolerances to pins and holes #9554\r\n- Fixed unintended path connections in Extra Perimeters when gap fill was applied #9480\r\n- Fixed occasional crashes with specific brim geometries  #9513, #9489, #9543\r\n- Fixed crashes of stability alert checker, when empty print object was passed to it\r\n- Fixed occasional crashes when using modifier meshes #9466, #9511, #9518\r\n- Fix of a crash with sequential print and raft #9464, #9509, #9522\r\n- macOS specific: PrusaSlicer 2.6.0-alpha2 has issues starting in certain languages because of locales-related issues. A temporary workaround was implemented and the application now starts with English locales (an error message is shown on startup). The issue is being investigated further  #9476\r\n- A validation check was added for scenarios not yet supported in the alpha: Organic supports do not work with variable layer height, Avoid crossing perimeters option and avoid crossing curled overhangs cannot be enabled together #9528\r\n- Contour shown in Cut tool did not show correctly when the model was scaled.",

It brings the most anticipated Organic supports, measurement tool and text embossing tool. Cut tool now allows orienting the cut plane and adding connectors, there is a possibility to download files directly from Printables.com and several new features were added in order to improve FDM print quality. There are of course many more improvements and bugfixes.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\nGithub clips this text at the release history overview. Please open the [2.6.0-alpha2 release log](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.6.0-alpha2) to see the complete change log.\r\n\r\n## Organic supports #1514\r\n\r\nUntil now, PrusaSlicer's supports consisted of 2D \"scaffolding\" created on a regular 2D grid. While the approach produced reasonably good results in many cases, they often consumed quite a lot of filament, took a long time to print, ended up in spaces where they are difficult to remove from and left visible scars on the model when removed (especially when the settings were not tuned correctly). We improved some of these downsides by introducing the \"Snug\" supports in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0, but they are still an upgraded version of the old and limited approach.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach, which was pioneered by different 3D modeling softwares and slicers are \"Tree supports\" - support structures designed to save material and printing time as much as possible. Branches of supports are generated where needed and limit contact areas to a necessary minimum. This results in a better surface of the original model. The community has rightfully complained that not having this style of supports in PrusaSlicer is a severe disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIn this release, we are presenting our implementation of tree supports, which we decided to call 'Organic supports' because of their smooth shape. The algorithm is based on @ThomasRahm 's implementation of tree supports, which are significantly improved tree supports originally from Cura. We would like to thank [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) and @ThomasRahm [(see his Reddit post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/p7n4x4/i_created_a_new_tree_support_implementation_for/) for the effort they have invested into the problem.\r\n\r\nThe supports are easily removable, do not scar the surface and are fast and cheap to print. The algorithm automatically uses double perimeter walls for the trees where needed to improve structural capabilities. Like other support types implemented in PrusaSlicer, Organic supports can be enforced or blocked using the Paint-on supports tool.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214853855-d8629369-64a4-4c92-b475-b20193c8f89a.png\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\nWe recommend to use the Organic supports together with the following two new features (see their respective sections below): \r\n- *Automatic FDM support painter* produces the right amount of supports for sufficient model stability.\r\n- *Avoid crossing curled overhangs* reduces risk of print head kicking the model and angled tree supports off the build plate.\r\n\r\nThe Organic supports currently pose the following limitations:\r\n- For large models with a lot of supports, 16GB RAM minimum is recommended.\r\n- Top / bottom vertical separation distances are rounded to multiples of layer height.\r\n- Variable layer height is not supported.\r\n- Interface layers are not always produced reliably. As of now printing with zero interface layers is recommended, which produces easy to remove supports.\r\n- Rafts with Organic supports are buggy.\r\n\r\n## Measurement tool #3651\r\n\r\nMeasurement tool is another feature long demanded by our community. The tool utilizes a geometry detection algorithm that recognizes points (vertices), edges, circles and planes. Users can check model sizes and angles directly in the slicer, so there is no need to open 3rd party software anymore for this purpose. At the moment, it is possible to measure between parts to simplify their better manipulation and organization inside objects (but not between separate objects). Last but not least, the tool allows to uniformly scale the object to the required length by clicking a button in the scene.\r\n\r\nOne of the current limitations of this tool is its behavior on objects with overlapping parts. In such cases, the parts are considered individually, meaning that edges created by the intersections are not detected, and planes hidden inside other parts are. The tool also does not work well with negative volumes, which are considered as parts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214780664-b718d015-4a9e-4c27-9379-a7229eee6d96.gif\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Text embossing tool\r\n\r\nThis tool opens a new capability to insert, manipulate and edit text created like a new volume of an object. It allows to add notes, signs, serial numbers, etc. directly in the slicer.\r\n\r\nThe text can be placed on any type of surface, not only a planar one. There is an option to \"Use a surface\", which forces the text to follow the parent object surface along the whole text length. Text manipulation can be simply performed by dragging text around the object to be placed in the desired position. There are also possibilities to rotate (Z-rot) and elevate (Z-move) text directly in the Emboss panel. \r\nThe text editor automatically imports fonts from the user's system library. Basic or advanced properties of text are available to change and edit. Final text volume can be used like any of the usual types: part, negative volume or a modifier. The whole project with text entities is saved to 3mf and after reopening, the text is fully editable.\r\n\r\nHow to use: right-click the object and choose `Add part->Text`.\r\n\r\n**Functionality overview:**\r\n- Insert and manipulate text volumes\r\n- Recognize and import the user’s font library\r\n- Edit text in many different ways\r\n- Create, save or delete text style\r\n- Set type of text volume – object part, negative volume, modifier\r\n- Use Surface mode to project text on an object's surface\r\n- Editing the text at any time, not only when created\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214840761-60bb39c4-9ddf-496a-81a6-5c6d2f40e137.gif\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cut tool update\r\n\r\nThe Planar Cut tool has been available in PrusaSlicer for a long time. It is handy for preprocessing huge models that don't fit the build volume, are too complicated to print in one piece, or models where only a part is valuable for the user. With this release, we decided to extend its functionality. \r\n\r\nThe model can newly be cut by a generally oriented plane (#4368, #5706). For cut plane manipulation purposes, the tool enables movement and rotation to an appropriate position. Z positioning is also possible to manage by numerical input value [mm]. Rotation around the X and Y axis is set up by a gizmo enhanced with 5 degrees snipping ability. Alternatively, the plane could be defined by selecting two points on an object or in space around it. To use this feature, press Shift and draw the requested cutting plane in the scene using the left mouse button.\r\n\r\nAlso, we understand how important it is for users to assemble final parts to a single object with an emphasis on precision and simplicity. That's why we added an option to define various types of connectors (#803, #8656, #5553, #1857). The user can enter editing mode for placing the connectors by pressing a button in the Cut panel. There are several shapes and styles of connectors to choose from. Users can also control the depth, size, and tolerances of each connector member and negative hole.\r\n\r\n\"Lay down\" options help automatically place removed parts straight after the cut performs (#3154). \r\n\r\nAfter the cut is performed, the resulting objects \"remember\" that they belong together and certain operations are not permitted. For example, one cannot scale one object and not the other, as that would make the parts not match. The information is visible in the Object List and is also saved into a 3MF. It is of course possible to break this correspondence and manipulate the objects without limitations.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214780846-9db779d1-8476-41e1-84cc-d70be4303346.gif\" width=\"75%\">\r\n\r\n## Automatic FDM support painter and print checker\r\n\r\nFor a long time, PrusaSlicer allows the user to paint areas to be supported. This is a much praised feature that allows the user to customize supports quickly and easily. As part of a large effort to create more intelligent support creation, the FDM support painting tool now contains an option for automatic painting of enforcers on the model.  The algorithm behind this tool checks the print extrusion by extrusion and takes into account many factors such as the center of mass, weight of the supported part, bed movement, potential extruder collision, bed adhesion, material, and bridging. The result should be more effective support placement. For example, bridges are supported only on regularly spaced pillars and not over their full length. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214854017-afc0341e-64d9-4a8f-ac9b-b72091754e76.PNG\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\nThe tool is also executed during slicing, providing conservative warnings in case no supports are to be generated but most likely some supports are needed. Experts may find such warning obtrusive, thus the warning may be disabled in application preferences.\r\n\r\n## Dynamic overhang speed #9348\r\n\r\nDynamic overhang speed functionality enables reliable slowdown of overhang extrusions. Lower velocity enables proper cooling when it is needed. The algorithm calculates extrusion overlap with the previous layer and applies speed calculated from the overhang slowdown function. Users can control the shape of the overhang slowdown function via four input points - each point has an extrusion overlap value expressed as percentage of the full width, and desired speed on such overlap. The speeds in between the control points are calculated via linear interpolation.  The feature is configurable in `Print settings -> Speed -> Dynamic overhang speed`.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214841219-dea28411-1f4b-415c-9b27-01a5e07b59b3.png\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\n## Extra perimeters on overhangs (EXPERIMENTAL)\r\n\r\nThis functionality detects overhang areas where bridges cannot be anchored, and fills them with extra perimeter paths. These paths are generated as perimeters of the overhang area and anchored to the non-overhanging areas when possible. The perimeters are then cut, sorted such that the area is filled from anchors outside such that each new path should be printed next to previous, and reconnected when possible. This feature can improve the quality of larger overhangs on many models as well as making some overhangs printable without supports.\r\nConfigurable in `Print Settings -> Layers and Perimeters -> Quality -> Extra perimeters on overhangs`.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214793652-805e78fa-6ea5-4be4-9e1a-f1ae06c85e18.png\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Avoid crossing curled overhangs (EXPERIMENTAL) #9081\r\n\r\nAvoid crossing curled overhangs is another new experimental feature. It aims to plan travel moves such that the extruder avoids areas where the filament may be curled up. This is mostly happening on stepper-rounded overhangs and may cause a crash with the nozzle. The danger of curling is calculated from extrusion properties like overlap with the previous layer and local curvature. It does not take into account the direction of the fan and thus the avoidance is conservative and may avoid places where issues did not appear. \r\nThe feature also cooperates with the new organic supports, avoiding their overhanging edges under steep angles. The option can be found in `Print Settings -> Layers and Perimeters -> Quality -> Avoid crossing curled overhangs`.\r\n\r\n## Downloads from Printables.com #8674\r\n\r\nThe new Downloader feature enables the user to easily access and download models directly through the [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/) site. By clicking on the PrusaSlicer logo on Printables.com, a new instance of the PrusaSlicer will open and the selected model will be saved to the user's folder. Users can register for the Downloader tool and select the target folder through the Config Wizard or the Preferences menu. This feature supports zip archives with STLs and 3MFs that can be downloaded, opened, or dragged and dropped into PrusaSlicer. Then, the user can select which files should be opened in a new dialog. Note that if multiple 3MF projects are selected, all load as geometry only. Additionally, opening a 3MF project now also opens in a new instance of PrusaSlicer.\r\n\r\n**Currently the user has to enable the downloader icon in their printables.com profile in order to use this feature.** After the final release of 2.6.0, the icon will be visible by default (with the option to hide it).\r\n\r\n## Template filaments #3566, #3729\r\n\r\nUntil now only system filament presets that were defined in printer vendor profile files were possible to use. Now we have added an additional profile that defines most of the filaments separately and is possible to use with every printer. In the Configuration Wizard, there is a new (Templates) category among Printers. There, the user can add filaments visible for every printer. If any other printer defines the same filaments (for example Prusa printers), template filaments will be available for other printers without the need to select them. After the installation in the right panel, there is a new category '--Template presets--' among Filaments. Please note that these profiles were usually set for Prusa printers and it is recommended to check all values in the Filament Settings. Then saving a copy of a template preset will offer a checkbox to save as a preset derived only for the current printer.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214781020-fe8f96e7-fe48-4384-8833-38da0acdf707.png\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\n## 'Monotonic lines' top/bottom fill pattern\r\n\r\nNew top/botom infill pattern was introduced: 'Monotonic Lines'. It is very similar to Monotonic, except that adjacent lines are not connected. This allows for smaller perimeter/infill overlap and results in better filling of the top/bottom layer, less over-extrusion and better dimensional accuracy.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214859075-d250d4a8-e24c-443e-8af4-30a29e9b62db.png\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New experimental tree-like support strategy for SLA\r\n\r\nTo join the Tree support fever, PrusaSlicer's SLA algorithms now contain a new, experimental support generation strategy that builds tree-like supports similar to that introduced in FDM mode.  As a side-result of our time spent on tree supports in general, this strategy is inspired by the paper \"[Clever Support: Efficient Support Structure Generation for Digital Fabrication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264549729_Clever_Support_Efficient_Support_Structure_Generation_for_Digital_Fabrication)\". The new strategy is called **\"branching supports\"** to differentiate from the previous strategy which is still the default. The biggest advantage of these new supports is their ability to save print material. Their ability to avoid the model body is also much improved compared to the default support strategy.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/214870028-41b0ed47-97e1-4afb-94e5-297f3fe0dc4c.png\" width=\"50%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Multipart objects in SLA\r\n\r\nSLA mode is now able to host models with multiple volumes including negative ones which also makes text embossing available in SLA mode. Support blocking and enforcing regions can also be added to the scene to guide the automatic support point generator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Multi-material printing\r\n\r\nThis release introduces several fixes and improvement related to multi-extruder printers (with multiple independent extruders).\r\n\r\n- Ooze prevention feature was reworked. This feature was designed to reduce oozing by decreasing temperature of currently inactive extruders and by wiping the nozzle on a tall skirt, which was always printed when this feature was enabled.\r\nIn this release, the tall skirt is no longer tied to Ooze prevention, the user can turn it on separately. Ooze prevention only reduces temperature of the extruders which are being parked. **This is a breaking change affecting behavior of existing profiles.**\r\n- Ooze prevention \"delta\" temperature can now be defined per-filament #9235. There is an additional option in Filament Settings: `idle_temperature`. It is optional, which is a new concept of configuration option, so far only known from Filament Overrides. When it is checked and \"Ooze prevention\" is active in Print Settings, the value is used. When it is unchecked, ooze prevention uses the old \"delta\" value as it always did.\r\n- First layer temperature is correctly applied even with Ooze prevention enabled. Previously, temperature for other layers was sometimes incorrectly applied. #9263, #1107 \r\n- 'Ooze prevention' can now be enabled even with the wipe tower #9089.\r\n- When using ooze prevention, the temperature setting at the beginning of the print and when transitioning to the second layer sets all but the printing exruder to idle temperature. Previously, all extruders were set to their first/other layer temperature #7532.\r\n- Custom Start G-Code has a new placeholder: `is_extruder_used`. It is a vector of bools telling whether that extruder is used in the print.\r\n- `layer_z` placeholder is now available in start filament gcode, regardless of whether the wipe tower is enabled or not.\r\n- When printing with the wipe tower with multi-extruder printer, the toolchange is triggered before travelling to the wipe tower #5377, #4550.\r\n- When using a multiextruder printer, `toolchange_retraction` parameter is now honored. Previously, \"normal\" retraction was applied before toolchange.\r\n- Deretraction when starting to purge the new tool was sometimes missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to 2.5.0\r\n\r\n- SLA slices can now be exported not only in the usual SL1 format with PNG slices but also in SVG. The output can also be a PWMX archive (#7917, thanks to @ole00). If the exported archive contains SVG slices, it can also be imported through the SLA import dialog.\r\n- Vendor profile index files (.idx) are now downloaded as one zip file. This allows several changes: New printers and new vendors can be released without releasing a new PrusaSlicer version. Resources like printer thumbnails or printer bed models can be updated without releasing a new PrusaSlicer version. For not yet installed vendors, Config wizard now presents and installs the latest profile version. For already installed vendors, there is still an update offered like in previous versions.\r\n- Notifying about new releases was improved. When the new release version is out, PrusaSlicer will suggest download of installation or executable file. This download is done by PrusaSlicer. Alfa and beta releases are now promoted via notification.\r\n- When double clicking a 3MF file in system viewer or drag and dropping the file on PrusaSlicer window/icon, PrusaSlicer will newly ask if the user wants to open the project or import geometry only #6377\r\n- G-code preview settings were moved from the bottom toolbar into the G-code legend window.\r\n- Slicing with \"only_retract_when_crossing_perimeters\" enabled is now much faster.\r\n- When changing toolbar size in Preferences, the changes are visible immediately\r\n- Windows specific: When the application tries to automatically switch to MESA OpenGL library and the system opengl32.dll is not unloaded, the user is prompted with a dialog asking to rerun using the `--sw-renderer` command line option.\r\n- Added detection for corrupted PrusaSlicer.ini and fixed showing instructions on how to recover from it (#8217). This is an issue sometimes happening on Windows for unknown reasons.\r\n- An error message is shown when trying to import invalid 3MF #8401\r\n- Allow drag and drop of files into PrusaSlicer regardless of the currently selected tab.\r\n- When a print contains a custom G-Code inserted using the vertical slider, the view does not automatically switch to Color Print (#8413, #5837).\r\n- G-Code Viewer can now process G-Code files produced by BambuStudio.\r\n- User print/filament/printer profiles can now be renamed (#7851). Until now, this was not possible to do from the UI.\r\n- Sending G-Code to Repetier server now works even with \"rebranded\" Repetier. Also, forcing autostart should now work reliably with Repetier (#7807).\r\n- Added an error message when attempting to overwrite a 3MF file in a protected folder.\r\n- \"Compare Presets\" dialog now allows to show currently edited (i.e. still unsaved) presets.\r\n- When defining a custom printer in the Configuration Wizard, there is a new field to enter its maximum height.\r\n- Editing fields for custom Start and End G-Codes in Printer Settings are now taller to reduce the need for scrolling.\r\n- A new arrange function parameter to set min distance from the bed edges is available (configurable after right-clicking the \"Arrange\" icon in top toolbar) #8442\r\n- \"Compare Presets\" dialog now allows batch transfer from one preset to the other #5384\r\n- The \"Unsaved changes\" dialog when switching presets now shows values of currently modified options (in addition to their old and new values) #7393 \r\n- There is a new button in Extruder settings tab, which allows to copy extruder settings to all the other extruders #8720.\r\n- New palettes for mode markers are implemented. This update is specifically designed to help color-blind people, who are unable to distinguish between modes easily #7454\r\n- Upload to PrusaLink uses HTTP PUT operation rather than POST. Which one is used is decided on information read during initial connection (upload-by-put).\r\n- Physical printer Original Prusa MK2.5 and MK2.5S can be set up as PrusaLink #9213\r\n- New host type \"PrusaConnect\" is available. While its inner communication with the host is the same as uploading to PrusaLink, from the user perspective there is a URL address prefilled in the hostname (but still changeable) and there is a message displayed in the upload notification after the upload. The message shows additional info about queuing and printing. Also, there are 3 ways to upload to PrusaConnect: Upload, queue, and print. HTTP digest on PrusaConnect is disabled.\r\n- For physical printers with configured URL address, it is newly possible to open a web browser at that particular URL address from the physical printer context menu under the \"cog\" button next to the physical printer preset in the right panel.\r\n- Object manipulation is enabled when all parts of a single object are selected .\r\n- Size and position of Shape Gallery window is now saved and used when opening the window repeatedly #8728\r\n- The G-Code Viewer is now able to correctly process G2 and G3 G-Codes.\r\n- Improved time estimation for G-Codes produced by KISSlicer\r\n- Archimedean Chords, Hilbert, and Octagram Spiral infill types should now be faster to generate #8932\r\n- Vendors are now listed alphabetically in Config Wizard (#8795, thanks @snadorp)\r\n- Gap fill algorithm performance was improved #8164, #3259\r\n- Improved search function in Physical Printer Dialog - now it searches over all interfaces.\r\n- Windows specific: Internal address resolving was added when uploading to physical printer (OctoPrint / PrusaLink).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes with respect to 2.5.0\r\n\r\n- View mode no longer resets to \"Simple\" when exiting the configuration wizard early #8261\r\n- Windows specific: PrusaSlicer can be set to automatically associate 3MF and/or STL files to itself. This feature did not work correctly on new versions of Windows. It should now work correctly again (#8332).\r\n- When loading an invalid G-Code file into G-Code Viewer, the legend and bottom slider are not shown anymore\r\n- Model errors icon disappears after reloading the correct mesh #8228\r\n- When using the experimental option \"Set settings tabs as menu items\", changes in configuration options of Print/Filament/Printer Settings were not detected without leaving the respective configuration fields #8254\r\n- Fixed detection of the first layer in vase mode - first two layers were considered as one when using the vertical slicer in Preview #8202\r\n- When selecting volumetric speed visualization in Preview, the G-Code window would disappear #8327\r\n- Fix collision after arrange when 'Complete Individual objects' is on #8335\r\n- macOS specific: Opening of G-codes by drag & dropping the G-Code on the slicer icon did not work in case the slicer was not already running.\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed a rare crash on startup with specific system language and locales settings #8299\r\n- Fixed missing tool changes when previewing G-Codes produced by different slicers #8467\r\n- Fixed incorrect detection of temperature changes when previewing G-Codes for multitool printers #8467, #7548\r\n- Fix a crash when drilling holes in SLA mode with specific geometries #8521\r\n- Windows specific: 3DConnexion devices did not work correctly over remote desktop (https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/commit/e0f17bdfd408e2a54c73a0e720f161096d72ddb3, thanks @denis-itskovich and @supermerill)\r\n- Fix a rare crash on startup, related to icon scaling. Thanks @LucaRood and @supermerill (ported from https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/commit/c8bb0a46b83e44e4d19fa401bc14fa0ed24c7411) #8563\r\n- Linux specific: profile edit buttons were sometimes obscured by right panel scroll bar #8738\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed layout issues in Object Manipulation panel  #8693\r\n- When using the right panel (e.g. editing a value in Part Manipulation) and moving the mouse into the 3D scene, the 3D scene was taking focus from the respective control. This is now fixed #2519\r\n- Changing extruder using the vertical slider was only possible when the original extruder was set as \"default\" #8542\r\n-  Scaling objects using the Object Manipulation panel worked incorrectly when set to Inches #8439\r\n- \"Split to objects\" was missing in the context menu in Simple mode #8618\r\n- Detach from the system filament preset button was visible even when the preset was already detached.\r\n- Windows specific: When ejecting an older or faulty USB drives, they might have reported as correctly ejected, even though in reality the writing operation did not finish, leading to possible file corruption. This should be fixed now.\r\n-  The cursor in Search dialog was incorrectly moving to the end of the text  #9100\r\n- Fixed a crash when attempting to save a preset with an extremely long name.\r\n- In specific cases, Arachne generated artifacts not present in the original geometry #8846, #9357\r\n- In specific cases (e.g. loading a 3MF with FDM project while in SLA mode), the preset selection combo boxes would become disabled and therefore unusable. This is now fixed.\r\n- PrusaSlicer now uses OpenGL 3.3 which solves some crashes, mostly on Linux. An example is the crash after clicking variable layer height icon: #7274\r\n- Preview of a single layer using the horizontal slider was missing the last extrusion in that layer #8458\r\n- The \"automatic color change\" feature offering to insert a color change can now be disabled in Preferences #8380\r\n- Fix of additional rotation during mirror operation #9258\r\n- The project is marked as modified when the user adds custom G-Code #9144, adds color change #8710, or adds pause print\r\n- Comma is now accepted as a decimal separator for height range modifier input panel #8819\r\n- Fixed a crash sometimes occurring when slicing very detailed models #8834\r\n- Fixed an occasional crash when slicing a project for multi-extruder printers #8844, #8837, #8912\r\n- Object labels did not correctly handle non-ASCII object names #8850\r\n- Fixed a crash when splitting objects when the object contained zero volume parts #8931\r\n- The G-Code viewer did not process G10 properly, which led to incorrect temperatures shown in the preview #8941\r\n- Fix of object color rendering that was not possible to change after the object spit #9104\r\n- Re-slicing is now not needed when the user switches from the printer to the physical printer, and both have the same presets #8800\r\n- Fixed crash when importing invalid or corrupted G-code. A new warning window announces the imported file issue. #8252\r\n- The arrangement function did not work reliably for certain spacing settings. #9262\r\n- Fix of auto-arrange issue for models which are placed far from the coordinate system origin #8207\r\n- Fix of shortcut command (cmd+1,2,3...) that did not work when using Czech keyboard layout #9345\r\n- Fix of ‘Send System Info' pop-up that sometimes got stuck when sending the data #9365\r\n- G-Code export was failing when `TIMELAPSE_TAKE_FRAME` string was present in custom G-Code #8827\r\n- Fix a crash when thick layers, thick raft, and lightning infill were selected #9399\r\n\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n- PrusaSlicer now uses wxWidgets 3.2\r\n- Many unit tests were rewritten from Perl to C++\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Creality printers added: Sermoon V1, Sermoon V1, Ender-5 S1, Ender-5 Pro, thanks @pmjdebruijn\r\n- Elegoo printers added: Neptune 3 Plus, Neptune 3 Max, Neptune 3 Pro, thanks @mlee12382\r\n- Added Rigid3D bundle, thanks @mehmetsutas\r\n- Added Print4Taste bundle, thanks @sasosmolej\r\n- Added Anker bundle, thanks @just-trey\r\n- Added Geeetech bundle, thanks @alexwoo1900\r\n- Added BIQU bundle, based on PR https://github.com/slic3r/slic3r-profiles/pull/32 by @bkonosky\r\n",

See the release logs of [2.5.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0-alpha2), [2.5.0-alpha3](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0-alpha3) and [2.5.0-beta1](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0-beta1) for the complete list of changes with respect to 2.4.2.\r\n​\r\nThe release candidate saves its profiles into regular PrusaSlicer configuration directory. When you first run it, it will search for all configurations produced by alpha or beta versions and offer to create a copy of the latest one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.5.0-beta1\r\n\r\n- STEP import did not work on RPi builds because the necessary dynamically loaded library was missing in the archive #8703\r\n- When adding a custom shape in the Shape Gallery from a file containing non-ASCII characters in the filename, the automatically generated thumbnail name was mangled and the thumbnail was consequently not shown. The same issue appeared when there were non-ASCII characters in the username (or in path to a custom `--datadir` if used).\r\n- Fixed incorrectly computed starting position in Concentric infill when Arachne was used.\r\n- Lightning infill wasn't connected to perimeters when it was combined with the option \"Only infill where needed\". Lightning infill will now ignore this setting and treat it as off. Both features are intended to do the same thing (reduce infill) and the combination makes little sense #8648\r\n- Fixed unintended travels with Arachne and Spiral Vase mode. Classic perimeter generator is used instead for all the spiraled layers #8704, #8719\r\n- When extrusion width was changing close to the end of the extrusion, the next wipe might have ended up shorter than it should be. This is now fixed.\r\n- Fixed a performance issue in the seam placing algorithm.\r\n- Improved random seam, which sometimes generated lines and patterns.\r\n- Fixed an invalidation problem: when \"Only infill where needed\" was active and infill type was changed, the recalculated infill might not be correctly connected to perimeters.\r\n- The pressure equalizer was sometimes producing a malformed G-Code that caused underextrusion #8716, #8717, #8718\r\n- Windows specific: Since AMD driver version 22.7.1, there are issues with the missing texture of the bed, possibly caused by a bug in the driver which seems not to accept texture mipmap generated on the CPU for some reason. To workaround the issue, PrusaSlicer checks driver version and if it is AMD newer than 22.6.1, it generates texture mipmaps on the GPU. #8417, #8508\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n- Updated JA dictionaries\r\n\r\n",

See the release logs of [2.5.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0-alpha2) and [2.5.0-alpha3](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0-alpha3) for the complete list of changes with respect to 2.4.2.\r\n​\r\nTo let you enjoy the beta without worries, the beta builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-beta directory, so you may use the beta side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration. When you first run the beta, it will search for all configurations produced by alpha or final versions and offer to create a copy of the latest one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## STEP file format import #4989\r\n\r\nStarting with this release, PrusaSlicer is able to import STEP files, which is a format widely used for 3D modelling data exchange. Note that the model is tessellated on import and the slicing algorithms operate on the resulting triangle mesh, i.e., the model is not sliced analytically.\r\n\r\nWe use [Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT)](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT) development platform to read the STEP files. It is a CAD kernel also used e.g. by [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) or [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Thanks @Open-Cascade-SAS for keeping it open-source. The import implementation itself was ported from [BambuStudio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio), thanks @bambulab. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Arachne configuration changes\r\n\r\nParameters `wall_add_middle_threshold` and `wall_split_middle_threshold` were removed and are set automatically based on extrusion width. This results in better results in cases where the extrusion width of individual features differs (infill vs perimeters, etc).\r\n\r\nParameters `min_feature_size` and `wall_transition_length` can now be set in percents, in which case they are calculated based on nozzle diameter. Old profiles containing default values are converted into this percentage-based format, values that differ from the defaults are left untouched as the absolute values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.5.0-alpha3\r\n\r\n- Contours shown in the Cut tool were not properly updated after object orientation or scale was changed\r\n- When opening any gizmo using a keyboard shortcut, its input window now shows immediately, not after the first mouse move\r\n- Fixed crashes appearing in Arachne perimeter generator with certain models #8474, #8514\r\n- Prevented gap fill and Arachne from creating tiny gaps in extrusions in specific cases.\r\n- Fixed an issue when an open perimeter containing part of an overhang perimeter was split into two parts and wasn't extruded as continuous extrusion.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the pressure equalizer which would hang or produce extremely fast printing speeds in some cases #8457, #8461\r\n- Fixed a bug in Arachne perimeter generator which would sometimes produce artifacts not present on the original model #8446\r\n- Prevented the pressure equalizer from emitting `G1 Fx` lines which would not affect any actual extrusions\r\n- Fixed an issue with `wall_transition_filter_deviation` config option, which was evaluated incorrectly when set a percentage\r\n- Fixed an issue with the Arachne perimeter generator: a middle perimeter was missing in some specific scenarios #8472\r\n- Fixed unintentional deceleration before ironing caused by pressure equalizer. The same issue affected gap fill. #8530\r\n- Fixed pressure equalizer not slowing down before bridge infill\r\n- Fixed a bug in the seam placer which sometimes placed seams on overhangs\r\n- When using seam painting, some of the resulting seams would occasionally be incorrectly placed close to the edge of the painted area #8600\r\n- Fixed a failing assertion in Arachne on Windows (the assertion was harmless) #8597\r\n- 'Unprintable' state is now maintained after merging parts together #8668\r\n- Fixed printable state update after splitting an object\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n- Updated CS, DE, ES, FR, IT, PL translations\r\n- Updated zh_CN translation (#8544, thanks @iBral)\r\n- Updated pt_BR translation (#8673, thanks @valterfc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Added Elegoo bundle (Neptune printers) (https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer-settings/issues/162, thanks @mlee12382)\r\n- Added new Creality printers (Ender-3 V2 Neo, Ender-3 Max Neo, CR-10 SMART Pro) (#8602, thanks @pmjdebruijn)\r\n- Updated Creality profiles (#8602, thanks @pmjdebruijn)",

See the release log of [2.5.0-alpha2](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.5.0-alpha2) for the complete list of changes with respect to 2.4.2.\r\n​\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.5.0-alpha2\r\n- Lightning infill did not work when automatic extrusion width was used #8435\r\n- Fixed crash when lightning infill was used and some region had zero infill density #8436\r\n- Lighting infill generation was failing when it encountered very tiny polygons #8437\r\n- Fixed internal error reported by Arachne perimeter generator in rare cases #8447\r\n- Fixed empty `G1` lines which were sometimes generated by the wipe tower (this is very old bug)\r\n- Fixed a crash in Arachne perimeter generator occurring in some specific cases #8463\r\n- Tooltips in parameter pages did not show in some cases when hovering the label of the control #8459\r\n- A hyperlink in the \"Did you know\" notification that should open Configuration Snapshots dialog did not work in all languages localizations #8450\r\n- Fixed a hang in Lightning infill generator, which was occurring with certain models and configs #8488\r\n- When using the Seach function after switching modes (Simple/Advanced/Expert), the search sometimes navigated to a wrong parameter #8376 \r\n- Arachne perimeter generator sometimes produced extremely short segments even when there was no need. These extrusions could have been incorrectly shown as deretractions and also could have caused extremely short and counter-productive wipe moves #8455\r\n- When using the Classic perimeter generator, consecutive segments of gap fill are now merged when they have the same direction and don't differ in width (or only differ slightly). This reduces size of the G-Code and makes printer stuttering less likely.\r\n- Fixed a bug in pressure equalizer which introduced unnecessary deceleration (acceleration) before (after) ironing moves #8471\r\n- Fixed a bug in seam placement, which did not respect paint-on seams in certain cases #8464\r\n- Aligned seams in alpha2 were sometimes needlessly wavy, especially on simple geometries. This was improved and the effect is now reduced (although it may still appear in some cases) #8443, #8504\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n- Updated zn_CN translation (#8425, thanks @dingyifei)\r\n- Update RU translation (#8438, thanks @AndylgTom)\r\n- Updated pt_BR translation (#8449, thanks @valterfc)\r\n- Fixed a typo in JA translation (#8330, thanks @AkimasaKonishi)\r\n",

The Arachne perimeter generator was implemented based on the paper [[Kuipers et al., 2020](#1)], while the lightning infill was implemented based on [[Tricard et al., 2019](#2)]. Big thanks to Ultimaker for keeping Cura open source and big kudos to Cura development team led by @nallath, to @BagelOrb for his research and majority of the Arachne implementation and to @BagelOrb and @rburema for the lightning infill implementation.\r\n​\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n## Arachne perimeter generator #5591​\r\n\r\nThe 'classic' strategy for calculating perimeter extrusion paths is to offset contours of an object slice inwards by a constant extrusion width, one offset per perimeter. This was also the default algorithm in previous PrusaSlicer versions. However this simple algorithm does not handle thin regions well, as reported  [in these issues](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22gap+fill%22). Namely, thin regions cannot be filled with an integer number of fixed width extrusion lines. The classic way of handling narrow regions is to either not generate the innermost perimeter that does not quite fit, but to fill the remaining region with a gap fill algorithm, or to over-extrude the innermost perimeter. None of the two approaches are ideal: The gap fill may produce short segments of widely differing extrusion rates, while over-extruding may produce bulges on thin walls.\r\n​\r\nThe developers of [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/cura) recently implemented a new strategy named Arachne based on paper [[Kuipers et al., 2020](#1)]. The Arachne generator produces perimeter loops and gap fills with varying extrusion width in such a way, that the slice area is filled without underflows and overflows with possibly continuous paths while respecting minimum / maximum extrusion width limits. The Arachne perimeter / gap fill generator really shines on objects with thin walls as thin boxes or labels.\r\n\r\nIn this PrusaSlicer version, we have ported the Arachne engine from [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/cura) while keeping the old perimeter generator as an option. We made the Arachne perimeter generator default in our printer profiles. Thanks again to Ultimaker for developing Cura under open license.\r\n​\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176193437-be44ad83-dd9e-4ded-9044-9d2e48d6cd64.png)\r\n\r\nThe following picture demonstrates Arachne benefits on thin text: ​The classic perimeter generator fills text contours with many thin gap fill lines, while the Arachne perimeter generator widens the perimeter lines instead, producing cleaner prints quicker and with better surface quality.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176370182-320db883-2a8c-4388-928f-b72289b94339.png)\r\n\r\nHowever the Arachne perimeter generator has a tendency to round concave corners, as shown in the picture below. While the perimeter curves with circular segments at concave corners produced by Arachne are geometrically correct (they satisfy the constant offset distance requirement), they may not be optimal for FDM due to the tendency of extruded plastic to shrink into concave corners, thus the classic perimeter generator producing mitered offset curves with sharp corners may print more accurate concave corners. For most prints the Arachne perimeter generator is superior, but for some functional prints where the accuracy of concave corners is important the classic perimeter generator may be better.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176369821-d2a311a4-ddd0-43f5-83c8-3ebf0fa2873b.png)\r\n\r\nAnother case where the classic perimeter generator may be preferable are sharp corners. The classic perimeter generator with \"detect thin walls\" disabled trims the tips of sharp corners, but the print surface will likely be smooth due to constant extrusion width.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5830947/176430169-2bbd2079-d4bb-4e81-838d-e1209de9f9cb.png)\r\nWith \"detect thin walls\" enabled, the chopped off tip is filled with gap fill, which may not quite stick to the print.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5830947/176430282-b286749f-57a1-4394-9d6e-cbc50780bf08.png)\r\nArachne generator produces connected lines with varying extrusion rate, where the extrusion rate variation will likely cause some visible artifacts on the outer surface of the print.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5830947/176430545-63588d7e-75e7-4242-9cc3-4f7791659c1a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lightning infill #7344\r\n\r\nInfill serves dual purpose: To provide structural rigidity and to support top surfaces. In case the structural rigidity is not needed, a lot of material and printing time is saved with the new lightning infill, that is optimized to supports the top surfaces only. The lighting infill is based on paper [[Tricard et al., 2019](#2)]. A branching structure is generated that gets progressively denser towards the top surfaces to support them reliably. Like the Arachne perimeter generator, we have ported the Lightning infill from [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/cura), thanks again for keeping Cura open source.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5830947/176398929-2ef144dc-d612-4fcf-9abf-b21240f7fc0c.png)\r\n\r\nThe following table compares the print time and filament consumption when printing the famous [tree frog](https://www.printables.com/en/model/3116-treefrog) at 100% and 400% scale. The values for a 400% scale are enclosed in braces.\r\n| Infill type | Print time [min] | Filament total [g] | Filament Infill [g] | Filament saved on Infill |\r\n| --------  | ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |\r\n| Gyroid 15% | 54 (1104) | 6.8 (204) | 1.5 (114) | 0% |\r\n| Support Cubic 15% | 51 (792) | 6.3 (152) | 1 (62) | 33% (46%) |\r\n| Lightning 15% | 55 (840) | 6.0 (111) | 0.6 (20) | 60% (82%) |\r\n## Pressure equalizer (EXPERIMENTAL)​\r\n\r\nFDM printer consists of a motion system and an extrusion system. While the motion system loves to accelerate and decelerate smoothly to reduce vibrations, the extruder loves to extrude at a constant rate for best extrusion consistency. Unfortunately the optimal conditions of the motion system and extruder are contradictory. Bowden style extruders are especially sensitive to pressure fluctuations, due to the slack in bowden tube they are not able to reproduce rapid changes in extrusion rate reliably.\r\n\r\nWith bowden style extruders, moving from internal perimeter printed at high speed to external perimeter printed at slower speed the extruder often produces a bulge at the start of the external perimeter due to an excess extruder pressure. Similarly when moving from external perimeter to infill the extruder produces gap at the start of infill because of the extruder pressure deficit. To lessen these artifacts caused by rapid extruder pressure fluctuations, we have implemented an experimental \"Pressure equalizer\" feature.\r\n\r\nBefore moving from faster internal perimeter to slower external perimeter, the pressure equalizer slows down gradually the end of the internal perimeter to reach the extrusion rate of the external perimeter. Similarly when moving from the external perimeter to infill, the start of the infill is slowed down to external perimeter speed and accelerated gradually. The volumetric rate fluctuations are configured at `Print Settings->Speed->Pressure equalizer`, they are limited by the new _Max volumetric slope negative_ and _Max volumetric slope positive_ configuration values.  Slowing down infill after perimeter may increase print times excessively, thus it could be suppressed by setting _Max volumetric slope positive_ to zero. \r\n\r\n​The following two images show gradual slowdown when external perimeter is about to be printed and comparison of the result with and without the feature activated. \r\n​\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176193549-112890ef-3074-4a8f-8264-984bff475435.png)\r\n\r\nThe right picture shows bulges on external perimeters due to excess extruder pressure on a bowden style printer, while the bulges are mitigated in left picture thanks to the pressure equalizer.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176193638-3175be76-c2ed-49df-9746-e0203f6218df.png)\r\n\r\n## Visibility-based seam placement​\r\n\r\nStarting with this version, seam placement algorithm prefers regions which are not visible from the outside of the model at all or which are occluded from most directions. The new visibility algorithm is applied for seams set to Nearest or Aligned.\r\n​\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176193679-d5a30e9b-d3d0-4507-b4e7-627cca7eca97.png)\r\n​\r\nIn addition, when paint-on seams are used and 'Aligned' is set, the resulting seam line attempts to find a sharp corner in the painted area and snap to it, leading to smoother lines along the sharp edge. Previous versions did not detect the sharp edge in this scenario  #5857 #6086 #7180 #8014.\r\n​\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/176193730-6614d73f-9ceb-4b2d-b14f-d895a83c6af2.png)\r\n\r\nAlso the new algorithm strives to produce possibly long and smooth seams on smooth surfaces, while the old algorithm often produced disconnected random bits on such surfaces #4416 #7180 #7759.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5830947/176419441-b52d8213-a29b-4c7f-bc9c-b6bd1c848eef.png)\r\n\r\nFor multi-material or multi-part objects where a slice is split into multiple regions with each region having its own perimeter, the seams are newly hidden inside the object between the regions #5144 #6751.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.2\r\n- G-Code thumbnails can now be exported in JPG and QOI formats (until now, only PNG thumbnails were supported). This should make it possible to see the thumbnails on printers which do not support PNG thumbnails. Namely the Duet boards with RepRapFirmware are low on RAM to decode PNGs, but they happily consume QOI thumbnails. Thanks to @n8bot for initial implementation.\r\n- SLA hollowing was optimized and it is now significantly faster. The actual speed-up depends on the model, but in general it is several times faster. The difference is especially noticeable on bigger models, where it can be 10x faster than before.\r\n- SLA time estimate was improved and it is now more accurate for SL1S. In addition, \"High viscosity tilt time\" was added into Printer Settings so the time estimate is correct for printers supporting separate tilt time setting for high-viscosity SLA materials. #8421\r\n- Concentric infill is newly properly filled by the new Arachne perimeter generator if Arachne is enabled. #577, #1461, #3104\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.2​\r\n- OSX specific: It is now possible to send G-Codes to OctoPrint using self-signed certificates. The OSX system SSL library does not accept self signed certificate, however OpenSSL based libcurl library shipped with OSX does. See also the following [Prusa3D forum thread](https://forum.prusa3d.com/forum/prusaslicer/octoprint-https-validation-on-mac-with-2-3-0/) and #5984\r\n- Fixed a crash when using a selection rectangle with the cut gizmo open​.\r\n- Fixed a memory leak during slicing​ e0e34f6a53278121f779f34e8e25cf0716b11e7e.\r\n- Windows specific: Dialog asking to send system info shown at startup no longer pops up in case the internet connection is not available.​\r\n- Fixed a crash when using auto-rotation with some specific models #8319​.\r\n- When using arrange in sequential printing mode, it sometimes tightly violated desired extruder clearance #8335.\r\n- Fixed flickering of colored rectangles in legend in the stand-alone G-Code Viewer.​\r\n- When using wipe tower with no sparse layers, the first layer might have ended up too thin and ruined the print #7090​, #8358.\r\n- OSX specific: Cmd+M shortcut should now minimize the application as expected, restoring the application using the \"View All Windows\" works. #6364, #8352\r\n- When clicking the \"Detach from system preset\" button in Dependencies section of a profile, the button did not disappear. Also, detaching a printer profile from a system profile broke rendering of custom bed model for both the parent and child profile. Both issues are fixed now.\r\n- Fixed a very rare issue which led to generating a G-Code with commas instead of decimal points (caused by incorrectly set locales on one of the threads).\r\n- Windows specific: Improved detection of corrupted PrusaSlicer.ini configuration file. Very rarely for some unknown reason PrusaSlicer.ini is partially or fully filled in with binary zeros, most likely due to power outage or a bug in hard drive driver #8217.\r\n- OSX specific: When trying to open a G-Code file using drag and drop or \"Open with\" option, G-Code Viewer would report the file extension as unknown when PrusaSlicer was not already running #8300, #8344\r\n- Filament usage estimate was incorrect when using MMU. The loading and unloading moves were not correctly accounted for, leading to much higher estimate then reality. Only the 'Sliced Info' box was affected, the statistics at the end of the G-Code were correct.\r\n- Fixed a crash when rescaling the windows or changing color mode (Windows, OSX). This should fix some spurious crashes happening when moving PrusaSlicer window between two monitors etc.\r\n- Fixed inadvertent deselection after changing and confirming object-specific settings #8342\r\n- Changing object-specific settings incorrectly inserted two undo/redo snapshots.\r\n- Some configuration options always showed as modified in profiles inherited from the `---default---` profile.\r\n- Fixed a crash when pressing Ctrl+A while using a painter tool or editing SLA support points or drainage holes #8416\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed a crash when confirming a value in Height range modifier #7531, #8055, #8408\r\n​\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Added Infinity3D bundle (#8396, thanks @Amit4Infinity3D)\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n- Updated CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT, JA and PL dictionaries.\r\n- Updated zn_CN translation (#8383, thanks @iBral)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n<a id=\"1\">[Kuipers et al., 2020]</a> [Tim Kuipers, Eugeni L.

See the previous release logs for the complete list of bugfixes and improvements in the 2.4 series.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- When opening files through macOS finder on latest macOS, the model was not displayed in the scene until further action (e.g. slicing) #8170\r\n- Fixed a crash when Unsaved Changes dialog attempted to show a modified config option which is not available in current mode (e.g. Start G-Code in Simple mode). #7905\r\n- Fixed a bug that when the user was closing the application and replied 'Yes' in the dialog asking about unsaved project while also checking 'Remember my choice', it made it impossible to close PrusaSlicer in the next runs when there were no objects in the plater #8076, #8122\r\n- Loading of a G-Code in G-Code Viewer or loading config from G-Code file sometimes failed because of a bug in parsing of the configuration block at the end.\r\n- Fixed incorrect rendering of some characters used in the recently updated Simplified Chinese translation #8171\r\n- Fixed incorrect number of toolchanges reported in \"Sliced Info\" box when wipe tower was used. The annotations of toolchanges in G-Code were also numbered wrong #8186\r\n- Fixed a crash when using the \"Import SL1 Archive\" function and either cancelling the dialog or confirming a non-existing file #8175 \r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- Recycling symbols in Shape Gallery were mirrored so the user does not have to flip them when using them as negative volumes at the base of the print (which is the usual use case). Also, PLA recycling symbol was added #7800",

See the previous release logs for the complete list of bugfixes and improvements in the 2.4 series.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- SLA mode incorrectly handled 3MFs from 3rd party software, resulting in misplaced SLA support points and holes in some cases (#6100, #7359, #7189, #7826, #7659). This is very old issue.\r\n- Vase mode preview did not show in cases when Custom Start G-Code lacked moves in Z #8032\r\n- When loading a 3rd party 3MF using drag and drop. PrusaSlicer no longer asks if the 3MF shall be loaded as a project (which makes no sense since it contains no config) and loads the geometry only\r\n- Using the Layer Height Modifier with the wipe tower was impossible with multiple objects. The wipe tower reported that the layer height profile is different, even though it was in fact set the same on all objects (#7711, #7903, #8044)\r\n- Fixed a crash on \"Convert from/to units\" when several objects were selected\r\n- Automatic color change for logo crashed PrusaSlicer in certain cases (when a one-layer object was present) #8156 \r\n- macOS specific: It is now possible to restore PrusaSlicer by clicking the dock icon after minimizing it. Partial fix was already in 2.4.1, this release should fix it for good on all macOS versions both Intel and ARM (#6364, related to #7981).\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed a crash on opening projects in some cases (#8078, #8097)\r\n\r\n## Localization\r\n- Fixed minor errors in German translation #8024\r\n- Updated Simplified Chinese localization (#8105 - thanks @kang-kang)\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Added Snapmaker bundle (Snapmaker A250, Snapmaker A350). Based on https://github.com/nivekmai/snapmaker-prusa by @nivekmai, @WilliamBosacker, @mrworf\r\n- Added profiles for Zonestar printers (Z5, Z6, Z5X, Z8, Z9), based on https://github.com/slic3r/slic3r-profiles/pull/19 by @ZONESTAR3D\r\n",

This release only fixes several bugs found in beta3. For list of new features in the 2.4 series, please read the release logs of all 2.4.0/2.4.1 releases.\r\n\r\nThe release candidate builds save their profiles to the same directory as the last release. If you already tested any of the PrusaSlicer 2.4.1 beta builds, you will be offered to import the recent beta profiles.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- G-Code Substitutions were incorrectly applied on initial and final M73 internal placeholders, which unexpectedly mangled the M73 commands #7978\r\n- G-Code Substitutions were incorrectly applied on the commented-out configuration block at the end of the G-Code #7952 (this was fixed in beta3 already)\r\n- Windows specific: When loading a 3MF by double clicking the file, the project name was sometimes (depending on current local codepage) mangled when the file name contained non-ASCII characters. This could also have caused occasional crashes when sending file to print host (#7681, #7173 and #7845)\r\n- macOS specific: The fix of Cmd+M shortcut not minimizing the application which was made in beta3 was reverted, because it made PrusaSlicer crash on older macOS versions(#7981). The fix has been postponed into PrusaSlicer 2.5 release.\r\n",

This patch release adds several little improvements and fixes some bugs found in the [2.4.1-beta1](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.4.1-beta1).\r\n\r\nThis release saves its configuration into a dedicated beta configuration folder to avoid breaking production profiles. PrusaSlicer 2.4.1-beta3 will offer to copy configuration from any older release into the beta configuration folder on the first invocation.\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to 2.4.1-beta1\r\n\r\n- In [2.4.1-beta1](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.4.1-beta1), we added a check that `G92 E0` is present in layer change G-Code when relative extruder addressing is used. This is needed to prevent error accumulation in firmware. From this version, the check is only applied for Marlin firmware, because as far as we know, other firmware flavors do not suffer from this issue. #7846\r\n- Related to the previous improvement: our G-Code preview works by mimicking the Marlin firmware, therefore if the `G92 E0` was missing and the error accumulation became visible, it would also be visible in the G-Code preview. Because only Marlin firmware suffers from this issue in reality and there is an explicit check for the `G92 E0` when Marlin is selected, we have now modified the G-Code Preview so the loss of precision problem is not visualized. #4881, #5073, #6336\r\n- Clicking 'Delete All' button to delete all currently defined G-Code substitutions is newly followed by a confirmation dialog, so it is not possible to delete the entries by mistake #7850\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- Fixed wrapping of text in modal dialogs, unnecessary line breaks were sometimes present\r\n- 'Compare presets' dialog was missing an info text about values being truncated #7852\r\n- When a 3MF with an SLA project was loaded and there were no SLA printers installed, the presets from the 3MF should have been temporarily installed. Instead, the list of SLA materials was incorrect and possibly even empty. This is quite an old bug.\r\n- Fixed an issue with a gap in the brim when the inner brim was used\r\n- When the outer brim of an object was very wide, it could overflow into a hole in another object\r\n- Saving a preset after a modification incorrectly marked the currently opened project as saved #7849\r\n- Some settings showed confusing indeterminate labels when they were modified per object in Object Manipulation panel #7887\r\n- Improved robustness of multi-material painting, which sometimes produced gaps in the painted area of did not propagate it deep enough into the original volume #7838, #6892\r\n- Linux specific: Print Settings and Filament/Material Settings controls were disabled after a specific sequence of loading projects and switching between FDM and SLA mode.\r\n- macOS specific: Cmd+M did not minimize the application as it should have. This is now fixed for Intel Macs, the problem persists on ARMs.\r\n- Exporting a volume as STL did not take into account possible transformation (rotation and scaling) of the model. This bug was introduced in 2.4.1-beta1. #7906\r\n- Fixed incorrectly shown cut contour in the Cut tool when cutting in SLA mode and the object was elevated because of supports\r\n\r\n\r\n## Localization\r\n- Updated CS, DE, ES, FR, IT, and PL dictionaries\r\n",

This patch release adds several small improvements and 3rd party profiles, fixes some bugs found in the 2.4.0 final and typos found in translations.\r\n\r\nThis release saves its configuration into dedicated beta configuration folder to avoid breaking production profiles. PrusaSlicer 2.4.1-beta1 will offer to copy configuration from PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 or any older release into the beta configuration folder on first invocation.\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to 2.4.0\r\n\r\n### G-Code substitutions\r\n\r\nPrusaSlicer supports processing of the generated G-code with an external post-processor for a long time. Launching an external post-processor is versatile, however it is complex to setup, the post-processing scripts must be distributed with the project and the interpreter running the post-processing script (for example Python) has to be available. We collected many real world use-cases for the post-processing scripts and concluded that many of them could be covered by a simple \"Find and Replace\" tool with regular expression matching and substitutions.\r\n\r\nTo make life easier for everyone who only needs basic post-processing, we now integrated such a tool directly into PrusaSlicer. It is accessible from Print Settings -> Output options and allows to add a number of find and replace pairs, with optional regex matching, case sensitivity and whole word matching, similar to what common text editors offer. The G-Code is processed before it is previewed, so your changes will be visible in the G-Code preview.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/151135471-6896a58e-f283-4032-a22e-6396464c5391.png)\r\n\r\nWe hope this tool will make common post-processing tasks simpler, such as adding custom annotations, adjustments of output format such as in #6996), [ringing cancellation](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/7802#issuecomment-1021610958), adjustments of per feature extrusion rate and similar.\r\n\r\nRegular expression syntax of Perl is supported as described in [boost Perl regular expression syntax](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html), where a \"single line\" modifier mimics the Perl's `s/` modifier. With regular expressions active, the \"Replace with\" pattern supports the \"extended\" syntax as described in [boost extended format syntax](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_78_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/format/boost_format_syntax.html). [Lookahead and lookbehind](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-javascript/lookahead-and-lookbehind.html) are supported by the regular expression engine, but only for fixed length patterns. With regular expression disabled, `\\n`, `\\r`, `\\t`, `\\0` and `\\\\` placeholders are supported in both \"Find\" and \"Replace with\" patterns similarly to Notepad++'s \"extended\" syntax.\r\n\r\nThe G-code find/replace post-processor processes G-code in blocks, where a single G-code block is generated for each layer starting with the Z up to move to the next layer. Multiple find/replace patterns are applied one by one to one G-code block before processing the next G-code block. Matching multi-line patterns is possible, however only inside one G-code block, most likely inside a single layer. Regular expressions are powerful but tricky, thus we recommend [the regular expressions 101](https://regex101.com/) online playground to get familiar with regular expressions and to test and fine tune the regular expressions modifying G-code before entering them into PrusaSlicer. Don't forget to switch the regex flavor to ECMAScript in [the regular expressions 101](https://regex101.com/) online playground.\r\n\r\nAn example of a quite powerful G-code modification by a reasonably complex regular expression: Increase the extrusion rate of top solid infill from the default 95 percent to 98 percent.\r\nFind: `(;TYPE:Top solid infill\\n)(.*?)(;TYPE:|$)(?!Top solid infill)`\r\nReplace with: `${1}M221 S98\\n${2}M221 S95\\n${3}`\r\nModifiers: `regexp`, `single line`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n- Seam placement was improved. In 2.4.0, seams on internal perimeters were placed close to external seams to reduce long travels between seams, with additional staggering of internal seams wrt. to the external seams, so that they do not overlap. This sometimes produced an internal seam on a straight perimeter segment, even thought there was a convenient corner nearby, producing a visible bulge on the outer surface. The internal seams are now placed close to the external seam, but not at all costs. The staggering is now disabled as it often produced unnecessary jerking of the printer. Also, there was a bug in the seam placement algorithm, which again caused excessive travels in some cases #7690 #7686 #7784.\r\n- In Spiral Vase mode, the G-code viewer used to assign a layer to each G-code segment of a spiral producing an excessive number of layers thus making G-code inspection difficult. The G-code viewer newly assigns a layer to a single spiral turn #4440.\r\n- A new option \"Ask for unsaved changes in project\" was added into Preferences to control whether the user shall be asked to save a project on closing an application or when loading a different project. The existing three options \"Ask for unsaved changes when...\" always referred to the changes in **presets**, thus they are now reworded to make it clear #7114.\r\n- Machine limits table in Printer Settings is now available for RepRapFirmware, while until now it was only enabled for Marlin #7347 thanks @n8bot.\r\n- Implemented new placeholders for output file name:\r\n    1) `initial_filament_type` and `printing_filament_types` (useful for multi-material prints) #5300, #7684, #7673\r\n    2) `initial_tool` and `initial_extruder` - zero based index of first extruder\r\n    3) `num_printing_extruders` - number of printing extruders.\r\n- New option \"Restore window position on start\" was added to Preferences. We have received reports of rare crashes on application start-up when trying to restore application main window position on some multi-display setups. While we were not able to fix the crash, we newly detect a crash during the window position restore and we suggest to disable the window restore option on the next application startup as a workaround #2939, #5573.\r\n- Windows specific: The build_win.bat script newly supports a low CPU priority compilation option  #7828 thanks @Jebtrix.\r\n- FDM printer firmware usually keeps an absolute extruder axis position using a single precision float representation, which leads to a loss of accuracy if the extruder axis is not resetted regularly. In extruder absolute mode 'G92 E0 is issued at each retraction by PrusaSlicer, while in extruder relative mode it is newly enforced, that either layer_gcode or before_layer_gcode contains 'G92 E0'. On the other side, in extruder absolute mode, 'G92 E0' in layer change custom G-code breaks slicer's assumption leading to horrible over-extrusions, thus 'G92 E0' is newly tested for and prohibited with extruder absolute addressing #6336 #5073.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed crash on some machines at the very start of the application. The bug was introduced to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta1 with the dark mode support #7560 #7574 #7613.\r\n- Windows specific: Dark mode is now enabled for all the new Windows builds. Let's hope that Microsoft will maintain the undocumented API that PrusaSlicer and other applications rely upon #7546.\r\n- Fixed a rare crash in Configuration Wizard under certain conditions, mainly on OSX #7655.\r\n- 'Place on face' function was very slow when used on some complex models #7587.\r\n- When 'Reload from disk' attempts to load an invalid file, an error message is newly shown, while previously the error was silently ignored #7550.\r\n- 'Export to STL' did not work for individual parts and modifiers, the option was grayed out. This was a regression wrt. PrusaSlicer 2.3.3 #7647.\r\n- Windows specific: Button in focus and the default button was not highlighted. The issue was introduced with the dark mode support in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta1. Because of missing Win32 dark mode support for buttons, we had to resort to flat rendering of buttons. However with flat rendering, Win32 buttons do not support highlight of a default or active button and we had to implement a workaround ourselves #7564.\r\n- Cancelling \"Fix by NetFabb\" might have left a temp file opened. This is now fixed #7632.\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed color of the text in Firmware updater window when firmware flashing is done.\r\n- Fixed crash during slicing when a negative volume was used on painted areas of a multi-material model #7618.\r\n- Fixed mangled text in \"did you know\" notifications when breaking a long line at a non-ASCII character #7611, thanks @odaki.\r\n- Fixed crash on closing the application on OSX Sierra and older #7583.\r\n- SLA pad model was sometimes not generated correctly, which was visible during preview visualization.\r\n- Removed empty `G1` command which appeared before bridging perimeters were printed #7714\r\n- Fixed some text encoding issues in Print host queue dialog.\r\n- The \"Unsaved Changes dialog\" used to inform that some of the differing keys are too long to be displayed fully and that one may open a pop-up window to show the full content of the differing keys. This was broken in 2.4.0 and it works again now #7734.\r\n- Avoid crossing perimeters was improved in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 to not move along the outermost perimeters. This feature did not work reliably for thin islands, which should be now improved #7699.\r\n- The Yes/No/OK/Cancel buttons on various dialogs were displayed using the system language and not translated to the language set in PrusaSlicer. This is now fixed by providing dictionaries for these buttons #7542.\r\n- Fixed possible crash during print host upload, likely related to #7681.\r\n- The G-Code Preview parser did not skip whitespaces between axis letter and number, so e.g. `G1 X 10` would not be correctly displayed in Preview. This was a bug introduced in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 due to G-code export speed-up #7773.\r\n- Some excessively wide message boxes were sometimes shown for example when showing a very long file path. The texts in message boxes are newly wrapped to keep the width of these message boxes reasonable.\r\n- When printing with a single extruder only with a multi-material printer profile active while the printing extruder was not the default one, the G-code viewer did incorrectly considered the printer to not support multi-material printing, thus the cog icon below the vertical slider did not offer the 'Set extruder sequence' option. This is now fixed.\r\n- When the type of an object part was changed from a printable part to a modifier, the part should be rendered transparent, but the transparency was not updated immediately.\r\n- Cut tool sometimes showed the cut contours incorrectly after object parts were added and removed.\r\n- Fixed crash when editing thumbnails in Printer settings #7781.\r\n- Fixed an incorrect invalidation of PrusaSlicer configuration in case old PrusaSlicer is started, which reports that it does not support the current configuration thus it proposes to downgrade configuration to a version it understands. In case the user refuses to downgrade, the configuration was incorrectly marked as downgraded #7780.\r\n- OSX specific: \"Did you know hints\" referencing Cmd-F hot key will now show Cmd-F, not Ctrl-F #7820.\r\n\r\n## Localization\r\n- Added Catalan localization #7566 thanks @davidjuanesb.\r\n- Updated CZ, PL, IT, ES, DE, FR translations (including previously not translated phrases and typo fixes)\r\n- Added Hungarian localization #5479 thanks @zomatt.\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Added Artillery Hornet profile based on https://github.com/slic3r/slic3r-profiles/pull/14 by @newbeetle\r\n- Added RatRig V-Core and V-Minion bundle based on https://github.com/slic3r/slic3r-profiles/pull/13 by @top-gun\r\n- Added Jubilee bundle based on https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/tree/main/software/slicer_settings/prusa_slic3r by @yvessa ",

This release candidate fixes bugs found in the first release candidate. For new features in the 2.4.0 series, please read the release logs of the 2.4.0 alphas and betas.\r\n\r\nThe release candidate builds save their profiles to the same directory as the last release, however if you already tested any of the PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 alpha or beta builds, you will be offered to import the recent alpha or beta profiles.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- Improved robustness of importing newer configuration, for example from PrusaSlicer-beta to PrusaSlicer configuration directory after transitioning from PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta to PrusaSlicer-2.4.0-rc.\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed update of non-modal presets dialog after Windows dark mode is enabled or disabled, also dark mode is now correctly updated after a newer configuration is imported #7496.\r\n- Improved handling of Windows dark mode and fonts during application start up for dialogs that open before the main PrusaSlicer window.\r\n- Fixed regression wrt. PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-rc, where \"detect bridging perimeters\" could not be disabled with support material enabled #7498.\r\n- Fixed offsetting of the \"avoid crossing perimeters\" paths inside an island away from the outmost perimeter. This is a regression since alpha3, where paths along holes in islands were offsetted outside their islands due to some recent refactoring. Also sometimes the offsetting failed and the print head still followed the outmost perimeter.\r\n- Fixed crash when switching type of a modifier to printable with circular print beds.\r\n- Loading modifier meshes was not properly undoable.\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n- Preliminary profile for Creality Ender-3 S1, slight improvements to Ender-2 Pro #7502 thanks @pmjdebruijn.\r\n- Updated Anycubic i3 Mega (S) #7092 thanks @slghb.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\n- Catalan language #7511 thanks @davidjuanesb.\r\n- Russian language #7501 thanks @AndylgTom\r\n",

This beta mostly fixes bugs found in beta4. For new features in the 2.4.0 series, please read the release logs of the 2.4.0 alphas and betas.\r\n\r\nThe release candidate builds save their profiles to the same directory as the last release, however if you already tested any of the PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 alpha or beta builds, you will be offered to import the recent alpha or beta profiles.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- Fixed regression since cc44089 in bed shape dialog, where the origin was inverted after reopening the dialog #7474.\r\n- Fixed crash with fuzzy_skin_point_dist set to zero #7468.\r\n- Fixed crash when leaving the G-code text editing field by selecting another preset page #7486.\r\n- Fixed crash on some NVIDIA Quadro graphic cards with travel paths visualized due to unorthodox definition of normal buffers #7461.\r\n- Fixed crash on some AMD graphic cards with seams or retraction points visualized. Some cards did not support instancing correctly, therefore we rather don't use instancing anymore https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/7461#issuecomment-991807602.\r\n- Disabled enforcement of \"bridging perimeters\" with support material enabled at an object level #7484.\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed \"No image handler for type 15 defined.\" error shown on start of PrusaSlicer before a dialog to offer importing configuration from other PrusaSlicer configuration was to be opened #7469.\r\n- Linux specific: Implemented support of newest Intel Thread Building Blocks after Intel made many breaking changes #6355 #7332 #7470.\r\n- Fixed bug in combo box background color in dark mode #7481 thanks @n8bot.\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\nEnder2-Pro profiles were provided by @spuder.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\nDutch localization was contributed by Simon Tillema.\r\n",

This beta mostly fixes bugs found in beta3.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the beta without worries, the beta builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-beta directory, so you may use the beta side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta3\r\n- Windows specific: \"Dark mode\" option now shows in Preferences even in standalone G-Code Viewer.\r\n- Optimization of G-Code rendering, which improves speed issues mentioned in #7415, for example of the volumetric speed preview.\r\n- When an existing configuration folder is found on application startup (for example configuration saved by PrusaSlicer alfa was found by PrusaSlicer beta), an extra dialog to decide whether its contents should be copied to active configuration directory was added to 2.4.0-beta2. The text in the dialog was now rephrased to be more clear. The existing configuration check is also no more performed when PrusaSlicer is started with a custom configuration folder set by the `--datadir` command line argument.\r\n- Automatic random colors generated for color changes were slightly adjusted to avoid generation of extremely light or dark colors.\r\n- We newly provide both GTK2 and GTK3 builds for aarch64 (64bit operating systems on Raspberry PI, Linux on Chromebooks). We provide both binary builds and AppImages, thanks @davidk for [showing the way](https://github.com/davidk/PrusaSlicer-ARM.AppImage).\r\n- We newly provide an AppImage for armhf (32bit operating systems on Raspberry PI) in addition to the binary .tar.bz2 distribution.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed resource leak that manifested by UI controls corruption and spurious crashes after application ran for a long time and parameter tabs were switched many times #7369.\r\n- Fixed label on the new 'Upload and Simulate' button added in beta3 for Duet print host #7424.\r\n- Windows specific, broken in beta3: With settings opened in their own non-modal window, a modal dialog opened from the settings window incorrectly opened over the main window, stealing focus from the settings window after the modal dialog was closed. This is now fixed #7419.\r\n- Fixed a crash of the stand-alone G-code viewer when opening application preferences #7430.\r\n- Fixed a crash in G-code preview with some OpenGL drivers #7415.\r\n- Since PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1, first layer height could no more be specified as a percentage of a layer height. When loading an old profile, the first layer height is being properly converted to an absolute value when loaded, but the user interface still allowed the percentage to be entered. A check was newly added disallowing a percentage to be entered #7418.\r\n- The dialog suggesting to enable 'Detect bridging perimeters' when supports are enabled kept appearing in an infinite loop under certain circumstances #7419.\r\n- Fixed robustness issues manifested with spurious infills after re-slicing #7442.\r\n- Fixed 'Rear' seam option, which was not always respected. This is a regression since PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpah1, which started to manifest after recent seam improvements.\r\n- Fixed sliders in SLA gizmos, broken in beta2 after the 'Edit' button was added. Changing of support points diameter, hole parameters etc. was not possible for existing holes.\r\n- Fixed reverting of a spiral vase mode setting with the \"undo\" button at the top of the Print settings page. Resetting configuration page to previous state using the undo button lead to a spurious dialog to change other settings in order to use spiral vase mode being shown #7146.\r\n- OSX and Linux specific: Some of the modal dialogs with Yes and No buttons incorrectly interpreted Esc key as Yes.\r\n- Fixed performance issues with \"infill only where needed\" enabled  #1696 #6385.\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed rare layout issues resulting in some of the combo boxes being rendered too small #7414, #7176.\r\n- Fixed 'Reload from disk' which did not work for modifier volumes and which sometimes shifted the reloaded object incorrectly #7429.\r\n- Fixed solid infill of all layers achieved by setting solid_infill_every_layers to 1. With ensure_vertical_wall_thickness disabled many layers were not filled at all, with ensure_vertical_wall_thickness enabled the layers were incorrectly filled with bridging infill #6736.\r\n- Fixed regression in FDM supports, were the support interface at first layer overlapped with expanded support base #7460.\r\n- Improved robustness of \"don't support bridges\" for bridging perimeters #7260.\r\n",

This beta mostly fixes bugs found in beta2. For new features in the 2.4.0 series, please read the release logs of the 2.4.0 alphas and betas.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the beta without worries, the beta builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-beta directory, so you may use the beta side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta2\r\n- [MKS WiFi](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-WIFI) print host is newly supported #5617, thanks @RandoMan70.\r\n- [Duet WiFi](https://www.duet3d.com/DuetWifi) print host newly allows to initiate a print simulation in addition to initiating an actual print #5157, thanks @mloidl.\r\n- Since 2.4.0-alpha1, post-processing scripts are run on a temporary G-code file before the post-processed G-code is copied to the final destination or sent to a print host. The post processing thus has to be done in-place and it must neither rename nor move the file, which was always required by the manual. In this release, this requirement is explicitly mentioned above the post-processing script input field and a more descriptive error message is shown in case the temporary G-code file is deleted or renamed by the post-processing script. See the respective [Prusa Knowledge Base article](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/post-processing-scripts_283913) for details and how the script may pass a new G-code name to PrusaSlicer if needed.\r\n- New config value \"gcode_resolution\" was added to control maximum deviation of the exported G-Code from the full resolution toolpaths. Very high resolution G-Code requires huge amount of RAM to slice and preview and a 3D printer may stutter not being able to process a high resolution G-code in a timely manner. On the other hand, a low resolution G-code will produce a low poly effect and because the G-code reduction is performed at each layer independently, visible artifacts may be produced. The G-code resolution defaults to 0.0125 mm, while modern 32 bit printer control boards are able to process G-code with about twice the resolution (0.005mm) with no issue.\r\n- The painting tools (paint-on supports and seam, multi-material painting) newly produce smoother regions. When mouse is moved quickly, the active spherical or circular cursor used to be applied at mouse positions only producing jagged edges, while newly the path traveled by the mouse is interpolated with cylinders producing smooth smooth boundaries.\r\n- Several icons in menu (Shape gallery) and object list (Sinking, Paint-on supports/seam/multimaterial) icons were added or updated.\r\n\r\n## Localization\r\nDictionaries for CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT and PL were updated by Prusa Research. Contributors are welcome, please check the [localization guide](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/blob/master/doc/Localization_guide.md).\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n- Count of custom G-Code lines shown at the vertical slider is limited to avoid tooltip flickering when the tooltip text is too long #7368.\r\n- 'Slice resolution' parameter was not taken into account in previous 2.4.0 prerelease versions #7364.\r\n- Fixed a bug resulting in support material interface pattern \"Rectilinear Grid\" value being [reported](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/7369#issuecomment-981150483) as unknown #7316, thanks @n8bot.\r\n- OSX specific: Fixed saving of G-codes with a custom file extension. When opening a \"Save\" file dialog with an output file name generated from the output file template, OSX file dialog strips the provided custom file extension and replaces it with the default file extension. This causes issues with a custom file output template, where a non-default file extension is specified. This was now improved and when a custom extension is provided by the output file name template, it is passed to the file dialog as the first extension in the list of file extensions supported, thus the custom file extension becomes the defaut #7190.\r\n- Handling multi-part objects with \"clip_multipart_objects\" disabled was broken in all preceding 2.4.0 alphas and betas, which resulted in some object parts not being printed at all. This is now fixed and with \"clip_multipart_objects\" disabled, individual parts are printed overlapping #7366.\r\n-Windows specific: \"Use system menu for application\" option in Preferences is newly suppressed for systems older then Windows 10. PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta2 did not start on Windows 7 because a Windows 10 only API was called #7355.\r\n- Fixed a possible crash when deleting objects while 'Arrange' or 'Optimize orientation' was in progress.\r\n- 'Arrange' and 'Optimize orientation' can no longer be executed simultaneously, one waits for the other to finish.\r\n- \"Height range Modifier\" menu item is no more available in 'Simple' mode #7381.\r\n- Windows specific: Text controls in settings tabs (for Custom G-Codes etc.) now correctly handle encoding. Non-ASCII characters were previously mangled on Windows #7384.\r\n- Linux specific: Avoid crashing with DISPLAY environment variable not set, just show a warning and print out a help screen.\r\n- When sending system info from the recently introduced dialog and sending the system info fails, the \"sent\" flag is newly not saved, ensuring that the user is asked another time during following application start-up.\r\n- When raft was enabled, visualization of objects' shells were not elevated above the raft in G-Code preview #7388.\r\n- Fixed a bug when 'disable fan for first N layers' was not respected with raft enabled. The cooling logic was broken for raft during recent refactoring to cool support layers together with the object layers they support #7232.\r\n- Windows only: Increased robustness of convex hull calculation by switching from floats to doubles. On other platforms the convex hull calculation was already using doubles. The insufficient convex hull robustness caused issues for some degenerate objects created for example by the cut tool  #7377.\r\n- \"Did you know\" notifications showed in English, even when the translations into a local language were available.\r\n- Fixed some crashes in G-Code preview with specific models #7396.\r\n- Avoid crossing perimeters did not work correctly when 'Detect thin walls' or 'External perimeters first' options were enabled #7209.\r\n- Windows specific, OctoPrint support: Beta2 introduced a workaround for mDNS discovery, however the workaround broke support for complex host URLs, for example with non-default host port specified. This is now fixed #7361 #7389.\r\n- Fixed incorrect rotation when volumes are being rotated by the gizmo while Alt key is pressed. This is a very old bug already present in 2.0.0.\r\n- Object labels showing sequential print order were sometimes shown when the respective menu item checkbox was unchecked #7207.\r\n- Fixed an issue with ironing, which was applied multiple times in case a part of the ironed top solid infill was inside a modifier mesh.\r\n- Fixed crash when trying to delete the last printable volume of an object #7408.\r\n- Windows specific, if installed by the Prusa3D Drivers installation package: The \"Drivers\" installer installs a 3rd party updater. The \"Drivers\" package used to install a \"PrusaSlicer\" link, which pointed to a 3rd party installer, which in turn launched PrusaSlicer. Unfortunately this broke launching PrusaSlicer by drag & dropping STLs and 3MFs onto the PrusaSlicer icon #6769. This is now fixed by PrusaSlicer launching the 3rd party updater, not vice versa. The 3rd party updater is only launched by PrusaSlicer if 'Check for application updates' is checked in Preferences. This overrides settings the 3rd party updater itself, meaning it will not be started even if set to check for updates e.g. every week.\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed zooming with a touch pad on some Windows laptops. This is an old issue which was fixed long time ago, then broken again in PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 #2750.\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed focus issue with some window managers with \"focus follows mouse\" enabled #5620 #6870.",

This beta mostly fixes bugs found in beta1.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the beta without worries, the beta builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-beta directory, so you may use the beta side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Windows dark mode improvements\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in beta1 change log, we continued in Windows dark mode implementation. This was a tedious work given the lack of support provided by Windows API, but we managed to skin most widgets and got reasonably nice look on both Windows 10 and 11 in the end. Main improvements with respect to 2.4.0-beta1 are included in https://github.com/prusa3d/wxWidgets/commit/4b7588eb0fec2d3e9b48e8b1d27e347ba91011a8:\r\n\r\n- Skinned title bar for most dialogs and frames\r\n- Redrawn Spin controls\r\n- Skinned tooltips, scroll bars, menus, and list boxes\r\n\r\nWe also improved dark mode version of \"Change volume type\" dialog and PrintHost dialogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta1\r\n\r\n- When copying system info from About->System Info dialog into clipboard, OpenGL extensions are newly enclosed in `<details>` tag so they are wrapped when inserted into a github issue #6830\r\n- Conversion from inches/meters to mm can now be done for all loaded objects at once, so the user does not have to confirm each object separately.\r\n- New functions in custom G-Code macro language: `round(value)` (rounds to integer), `digits(value, num_digits, num_decimals)` (rounds to num_digits and num_decimals, left filled with spaces), `zdigits(value, num_digits, num_decimals)` (same as digits(...), only left filled with zeros) #3472\r\n- New placeholder parser values for output file name template: `{num_objects}` (number of printable objects on the plater), `{num_instances}` (number of all printable instances on the plater) #2735 #3339 #4607\r\n- When selecting SLA support points by the selection rectangle, even points that are slightly obscured by the object are selected. Until now, the center of the visualized sphere had to be visible, and it sometimes hid behind even very tiny bumps on the object.\r\n- When running 32-bit build of PrusaSlicer on 64-bit operating system, the user is instructed to download the correct version. While such application will run, it will be slower and will easily exhaust memory.\r\n- Fixed a crash when uploading G-Code to a print host for the second time #7170\r\n- When PrusaSlicer detects there is a more recent configuration folder than the one it is about to use (such as an alpha/beta specific folder), the user is asked if he/she wants to copy that configuration into the current folder. A configuration snapshot is taken in case there is something that would be overwritten.\r\n- Added a \"Start printing after upload\" checkbox for Repetier server (#5351, thanks @scott0122)\r\n- Sliders presented in the in-scene dialogs always allowed to type in the required value after Ctrl+mouse click. Because this useful feature was too hidden, we now show a small button to the right of each slider to switch it into this mode:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/143658921-b2971b4f-9c22-4e12-a8e7-fb0b63db9aa9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- SLA material color can now be specified in Material Settings. The color is used for visualization in the scene and is also shown in the right panel combo box. Until now, the last FDM filament color was used.\r\n- Windows specific: When PrusaSlicer was downloaded from the Drivers bundle and installed using the installer, the created desktop shortcut launched external updater application instead of PrusaSlicer. The updater checked updates online, notified the user when a newer version was found and then started PrusaSlicer. The drawback was that command-line arguments were not correctly passed. This was now improved by switching the order: PrusaSlicer now runs the updater after it starts. This only happens when 'Check for application updates' is checked in Preferences and the built-in notification about the same thing is supressed in that case.\r\n- In-scene dialog widgets now accept Numpad Enter (until now, only Enter was accepted)\r\n- Shape Gallery dialog can now be closed by pressing Esc\r\n- Linux specific: Extruder colors in the right panel can be changed by clicking the cog wheel to the right of the respective filament preset #6759\r\n- When uploading G-Code to print host, the confirmation dialog now has an \"Upload and Print\" button (instead of a checkbox)\r\n- Changing purge volumes in multi material project did not mark project as unsaved #7265\r\n- Minimum diameter of the brush in the multi-material painting gizmo was reduced to 0.1 mm #7108\r\n- Configuration Wizard: when adding a printer profile with no default filament/material profile, the dialog is shown informing the user that one should be selected manually\r\n- When custom extrusion visibility is supressed in Preview, they are not taken into account when 'Volumetric Flow' view is shown. The scaling of the color palette is therefore more appropriate #7066\r\n- Context menu in the right panel now shows even when right clicking the name of the respective part, not just the 'Editing' column #7270\r\n- SLA material expansion correction can now be set independently for all three axes\r\n- Increased translation speed maximum in 3D connexion dialog to 30 (#3385)\r\n- 'Scale to print volume' now works with circular beds\r\n- When color changes are added using the vertical slider in Preview, the colors are newly chosen randomly. Until now, a fixed predefined sequence of colors was used, leading to issues when the color changes were not added in order).\r\n- Out-of-bed detection was refactored and is now faster\r\n- Support generator now merges bottom contacts, top contacts and interface layers where possible (always possible with soluble supports, with non-soluble supports it is only possible when they are extruded without bridging and have the same layer height). This removes thin loops of interfaces that were sometimes generated with complex geometries and should generally result it nicer support interfaces.\r\n- Added experimental filtering of propagated support columns to two extrusions, overlapping by maximum 20%. This filtering step will remove spurious columns that do not support anything, but it may also remove supports supporting tiny islands (which would likely not be printable anyway without user intervention, such as extending the supported area by painting).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n\r\n- Mirrored objects appeared darker in multi-material painting mode (except on macOS Monterey, where non-mirrored objects were darker). The issue is now solved on all platforms and operating system versions #7259\r\n- Multi-material painting did not correctly propagate top and bottom solid layers on mirrored objects\r\n- Fixed a crash in bed collision detection when there were sinking toolpaths\r\n- Fixed calculation of estimated times for individual layers for multi-material models #7110\r\n- Variable layer height editing did not not work when printing on raft (broken between 2.3.3 and 2.4.0-alpha1) #6999\r\n- Fixed an ugly artifact sometimes appearing in Configuration Wizard (incorrectly shifted printer images)\r\n- When supports are enabled and 'detect bridging perimeters' is disabled, a suggestion appears to turn it on. This suggestion newly only appears when the user makes the change, not when such config is loaded #6814\r\n- Bottom layer of a multi-material painted model had incorrect color when the object was partially below the bed. This is now fixed #7107\r\n- 'G-code thumbnails' config option now accepts an empty string to turn thumbnails off #7019\r\n- Fix of a crash when layer count exceeded 4095 in slicing code and MMU segmentation, likely specific to fine layered SLA prints #7168\r\n- Fixed a crash when a part of a multipart object is completely below the printbed\r\n- Fixed a possible problem in SLA mode: supports inside cavities might have ended up not attached to the model\r\n- When selecting an object while moving the mouse, only one part was sometimes selected #7160\r\n- Fixed missing sinking property in objects list for multipart objects with some parts completely below the printbed\r\n- Fixed incorrect handling of exactly horizontal surfaces that were painted (by supports/seam/multi-material). The painting was sometimes ignored.\r\n- Fixed `int()` function in the macro language: it did not accept an expression unless it was enclosed in double parentheses. Constants and variables were processed correctly #3472\r\n- Fixed localization encoding issues in Undo/Redo stack (introduced in 2.4.0-alpha3)\r\n- Clipping plane in gizmos was not shown correctly when viewed exactly from Left or Right #7211\r\n- Reworked an internet connection check before the new 'Send system info' is shown. The check sometimes did not work and the application was unresponsive before it timed out. It is now done differently (hopefully more reliably) and only on Windows. Linux and macOS open the dialog even without internet connection.\r\n- Fixed high CPU usage and nonresponsive application during parameter changes for objects with a large number of modifiers #7220\r\n- Brims were sometimes not generated in 2.4.0-beta1 (all objects missed inner brims, objects inside holes of other objects missed the outer brims too) #7213\r\n- Empty `G1 ` commands were sometimes present in the G-Code due to the cooling slow down logic. This is an old bug present in 2.1.0 already #3058 #5176\r\n- Default color sometimes appeared at the boundary of two multi-material painted areas #7112\r\n- Fixed a crash after a filament or SLA material was installed with a Configuration Wizard and then erroneously activated even though it was not compatible with the active printer profile #7169.\r\n- SL1 files produced by very old PrusaSlicer versions did not contain the used profile. When loading such a file, layer height to use is loaded from config.ini instead (it should always be part of the SL1 archive).\r\n- The settings in 'Import SLA archive' dialog now retain the selected value, so the users don't have to reselect them every time they open the dialog\r\n- Mesh errors after SLA import are now repaired (as they were in 2.3.3, but not in 2.4.0-beta1). This is a consequence of recent refactoring related to admesh library.\r\n- Fixed dimples in external perimeter after slicing multi-material painted model #7235\r\n- Fixed crash in the multi-material segmentation when some projected triangle is outside the bounding box of the current layer #7299\r\n- Fixed bulges of base color on multi-material painted models #7109\r\n- Fixed a beta1 crash after typing zero into scale or size fields in the right panel #7245\r\n- Fixed cut function that sometimes worked incorrectly when applied on multi-part object #7258\r\n- Fixed error when resizing object to bed limit (may be exactly equal to the build volume height) #7246\r\n- Fixed a crash after splitting object into parts #7282\r\n- Fixed a crash when simplifying a mesh and manipulating Undo/Redo after it\r\n- Simplification preview does not mark project as modified, invalidate slicing, insert Undo step nor remove painted areas\r\n- A warning about empty layers is newly emitted once per object, even when there are multiple empty layers detected\r\n- Fixed 'Volume' in the Info box in the right panel. It showed incorrect values when the selected volume was scaled and non-sense value when multi-instances object was selected. The Info box is now shown only when a single volume is selected.\r\n- Fixed a crash during slicing in SLA mode (localization dependent, present e.g in German) #7313\r\n- Fixed infinite loop of dialogs suggesting to enable wipe tower layer synchronization in some cases #6124\r\n- Empty layer warning sometimes reported false positives (broken after support top/bottom distance was separated) #6709\r\n- Simplify dialog no longer obscures the main toolbar when opened after undo/redo\r\n- When attempting to simplify a multipart object, user is newly informed that it is not supported (beta1 did not do anything)\r\n- SLA hollowing preview sometimes did not show correctly when it was toggled on and off again\r\n- Fixed a crash when entering negative values in sliders in variable layer height dialog (the range can be overriden with Ctrl+click)\r\n- Horizontal slider in Preview sometimes (after a specific sequence of actions) incorrectly iterated over two layers, not one as it should\r\n- Spiral vase mode was not applied when 'complete individual objects' was also active\r\n- Windows specific: OctoPrint did not work when using hostname instead of an IP address. This should now be fixed.\r\n- Linux, macOS: When exporting GCode, characters that are invalid on Windows are not allowed in the filename. They led to crashes when exporting to FAT/NTFS formatted drives.\r\n- Support generator: \"with sheath\" option now again uses the lighweight zig-zag algorithm for the sparse support columns, while PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1 to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-beta1 used the new \"stable\" zig-zag algorithm for both the non-sheathed and sheathed sparse support columns creating unnecessarily thick support column perimeters.\r\n- Fixed endless loop of \"Do you want to save the project?\" possibility in a specific scenario\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Translations, profiles\r\n\r\n- Updated CZ translation\r\n- Fixed a mistake in Korean translation (#7164, thanks @tangible-idea)\r\n- Fixed several typos in UI texts (such as #7161)\r\n- Added Ultimaker 2 printer profile (thanks @foreachthing)\r\n- Added several Voron printer profiles (based on the profiles from https://github.com/slic3r/slic3r-profiles, thanks to the original authors)\r\n- Updated BASF filament profiles\r\n",

This beta mostly fixes bugs found in alpha3. For new features in the 2.4.0 series, please read the release logs of the 2.4.0 alphas.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the beta without worries, the beta builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-beta directory, so you may use the beta side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration. If upgrading from any of the PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 alpha release, you may consider to rename your PrusaSlicer-alpha directory to PrusaSlicer-beta.\r\n\r\n## Send system info\r\n\r\nIn order to focus our future effort, we decided to optionally collect some general information about the systems PrusaSlicer is commonly executed on. Such system information will help us to deprecate support of obsolete platforms in order to concentrate on up to date hardware and operating systems to reduce maintenance cost, improve PrusaSlicer performance and to bring up new features. Please help us by submitting your system configuration to us, otherwise it may happen that we will deprecate support of some old or not so common systems too early.\r\n\r\nThe system configuration data collected is strictly anonymous and the full content of the data collected is available to the user for review from the new \"Send system info\" dialog. A unique system identifier is generated for the machine submitting the system configuration to identify duplicate records submitted multiple times by the same machine. The unique system identifier is anonymized by hashing with MD5 and salted with a \"salt\", which is unique to the \"system info\" service. We believe our method is sufficiently anonymous, however we are certainly open to suggestions by the security experts.\r\n\r\nWhen connected to internet, a dedicated dialog will open on application start up (or second application startup, if Configuration Wizard is opened on first start-up), showing exactly what information PrusaSlicer collects. When confirmed, the data is sent to our server using a secure channel (SSL) and the dialog no more shows up at the following application start-ups. No other data than those presented by the \"Send system info\" dialog are submitted, and it is not possible to trace one's identity based on the data submitted. One can of course decline to submit the system information data.\r\n\r\n## FDM support improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha3\r\n\r\nFDM supports were improved significantly in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0 alphas. In beta1, the FDM supports were improved further. \r\n\r\nA conventional FDM support generator generates support towers based on the differences between successive object layers and PrusaSlicer's support generator is not different. Such a local algorithm often either produces excessive supports, or it does not support long thin features at all. While we are working on a smarter algorithm that takes global geometry of an object into account, it will take us some time to make it ship shape. In the meantime, we made some adjustments to the current local algorithm. Namely, the FDM support generator algorithm was designed before introduction of the support blockers / enforcers and paint-on supports, thus it tried to be smart about not introducing too much supports while not missing supports below thin features, however such algorithm behaved unintuitively. Thus in this release, we switched off some of the unintuitive filtering steps and we rather rely on the user giving hints to the support generator using the support blockers / enforcers and paint-on supports.\r\n\r\nWe are still fine tuning our print profiles for the new \"snug\" supports. The \"snug\" supports behave differently than the old \"grid\" supports. You may want to experiment with different gaps between object and support interfaces, also the \"snug\" supports may require more interface layers than the \"grid\" supports to produce wide enough regions to be printable FDM technology.\r\n\r\n- Disabled enhancement of thin long overhangs to be supported. The enhancement produced supports at object corners, which were difficult to explain #3094.\r\n- Disabled filtering step that removed support towers in case the support contact island supporting an overhang was completely trimmed by the support / object XY separation distance. Such filtering made sense to reduce excessive supports before introduction of support blockers and paint-on supports, however the filtering step was the reason of PrusaSlicer support generator seemingly not respecting the support overhang threshold and support enforcers #1324.\r\n- Fixed missing interface layers for snug supports by propagating full overhangs before trimming by the support / object XY separation distance when generating interface layers. This change together with the previous topic significantly improves #6058 #6902.\r\n- Rounding / merging of snug supports using the closing radius parameter is now smoother, it does not produce sharp corners.\r\n- When calculating snug support interfaces below support contacts, the projected support contact areas are expanded to produce wider, printable and more stable interfaces. This fixes some missing snug support interfaces.\r\n- For grid supports, supports supporting steep overhangs are not covered with dense support interfaces, because steep overhangs are mostly self supporting. However this strategy did not work well for the snug supports with narrow towers, thus overhangs with all angles are newly covered with support interfaces #6331.\r\n- For snug supports the interface layers are newly angled at 45 degrees from the base supports and they alternate their direction by 90 degrees, making the interfaces cohesive.\r\n- Fixed planning of support interface layers with rafts and larger Z gap for supports than for the raft.\r\n- Regression to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1: Some of the support interfaces were not supported by the sparse support again #7014.\r\n- Fixed soluble interface support interfaces / non soluble base for support enforcers, where base support was supporting an object without interface layers #2849.\r\n\r\n## Improvements of painting gizmos\r\n\r\n- 'Smart fill' and 'Pointer' brush types introduced recently into multi material painting gizmo are now available at FDM support and Seam painting gizmos as well.\r\n- The FDM paint-on supports gizmo newly allows limiting the brush strokes to triangles highlighted by \"Highlight by angle\" slider. One may let PrusaSlicer highlight the overhangs and one can quickly mark only those highlighted areas that are essential to the success of the print while masking out the non-overhang areas.\r\n- With clipping plane enabled, the areas clipped by the clipping plane are no more painted.\r\n\r\n## Seam improvements\r\n\r\nWhen possible, PrusaSlicer newly places seams on internal perimeters close to external seams, reducing travel moves and retractions. For leaky extruders, bowden setups and leaky materials (PET, PVA) reducing travel between perimeters reduces gaps at their starts. The seams between the nested perimeters are not aligned exactly, but they are staggered by a short distance to reduce bulge of the outer most seam #6790, #6400, #6741, #6494, #6186, #5149.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha3\r\n\r\n- Circular print beds are newly fully supported: Objects pulled out of circular print beds turn blue and print paths outside of a circular bed are detected. Convex print beds are partially supported: The part of an object outside of the print bed volume is not yet highlighted with blue color. No collision detection is performed for non-convex print beds #5388 #6460.\r\n- Notifications about new PrusaSlicer versions available for download are newly available for prerelease versions (alphas and betas) as well. Notifications on new alphas and betas can be enabled / disabled in Preferences.\r\n- Several more improvements regarding notifications (new icons, adjusted timeouts, minimal time notification stays on screen, no focus on hover).\r\n- Windows specific: After a model is repaired by Netfabb successfully, a notification is shown instead of a modal dialog #7067.\r\n- Modifiers, support blockers and support enforcers are newly rendered transparent #7076.\r\n- The mesh simplification tool newly initiates calculation of the preview of the simplified model automatically, the \"calculate preview\" button is gone. The calculation can be stopped by pressing Esc key.\r\n- PrusaSlicer highlights toolbar items and print preset options with red blinking arrows after they are selected by the search dialog or when clicking on a hyperlink of a \"Tip of the day\" notification.  The red blinking arrow is newly newly supported by the Preferences dialog as well. For example, clicking the \"cog wheel\" icon of the \"Tip of the day\" notification opens the Preferences dialog and a red arrow blinks next to the \"enable / disable tip of the day\" checkbox.\r\n- Models with zero volume (for example an STL with one polygon) are no more loaded. Previous versions of PrusaSlicer loaded such files, but these objects did not show on Plater, which was confusing.\r\n- Reporting of repaired and / or corrupted models has been improved. PrusaSlicer newly distinguishes between three states: 1) Model is fine, 2) model was broken, but it is now fixed, 3) model is still broken. The three states are reflected by the \"warning\" icon at the side panel: If the model is still broken, red \"exclamation\" icon is shown. If a mesh was broken but repaired successfully, white \"warning\" icon is shown.\r\n- If a mesh was repaired during import into PrusaSlicer, the number of errors fixed is newly saved into 3MF, so that the status of an imported model is not lost.\r\n- New default shapes were added into the Shape Gallery.\r\n- Context menu is newly available for custom shapes of the Shape Gallery, which allows to delete a custom shape or to modify its thumbnail. The dialog also newly accepts the Del key.\r\n- Windows 11 specific: Fixed implicit setting of the dark mode.\r\n- Travel paths planned by the \"avoid crossing perimeters\" algorithm no more follow the outermost perimeter, but the 2nd outermost perimeter if possible. This should improve the print surface quality and reduce re-heating of overhangs.\r\n- Hollowing gizmo newly allows drilling larger holes for inserting magnets #6101, thanks @h-2.\r\n- \"Copy to clipboard\" at the \"System info\" dialog newly encloses the lengthy OpenGL extensions details into a `<details>` tag, thus helping to make the github issues easier to read #6830.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n\r\n- Fixed dimples sometimes appearing on multi-material painted objects, often happening on cylindrical objects #7104.\r\n- Improved detection of seams and their visualization by the G-code viewer. Some of the seam points were missed #6895.\r\n- Fixed incorrect default context menu if the right mouse button was clicked on empty space in 3D scene when several objects were selected.\r\n- Fixed some issues due to the recent admesh eradication in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha3: Fixed import of multi-material AMF files, calculation of mesh volume in the right panel after applying a transformation and flipped normals when importing some 3MFs.\r\n- Implemented processing of M109 G-code (set hot end temperature and wait) by the G-code viewer #7050 #7099.\r\n- Save (CTRL+S) is newly enabled for unnamed projects, it is equivalent to Save As #7054.\r\n- Fix by Netfabb is again available for all models, even those reported as manifold #7063.\r\n- Numeric inputs in 3D scene newly accept localized decimal separator. For example, one may enter decimal comma into the Cut by plane clipping plane height #7056.\r\n- Multipart objects are not supported in SLA mode, thus when a new SLA printer is added through the Configuration Wizard, it is only activated if there are no multipart objects on the Plater.\r\n- Mesh simplification tool did not work correctly when applied on a model volume or a modifier mesh.\r\n- Object transformation values at the side panel were barely readable with both dark mode and colored background of the coordinate text boxes enabled #7012.\r\n- Modifier context menu at the side panel was made consistent with the modifier context menu in the 3D scene.\r\n- With background processing enabled, background processing did not restart after Undo / Redo #7040.\r\n- Windows specific: Tooltips on \"Slice now\" and \"Send to OctoPrint\" buttons were getting in the way when clicking the buttons.\r\n- Fixed crash when turning on shells visibility in preview with background processing active.\r\n- Added automatic update of legend when switching on/off travel visibility in preview #7068.\r\n- Fixed non-uniform scaling of a volume using the part manipulation panel #6380.\r\n- Windows specific: Dark mode config option is now available in standalone G-Code Viewer.\r\n- Modifiers added to an object from the Shape Gallery are newly centered first before calculating their initial position relative to the object.\r\n- Fixed regression wrt. PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha3 due to G-code export parallelization: Standalone G-Code Viewer was again changing timestamp of the imported G-code #7005.\r\n- Fixed another regression due to G-code export parallelization: M106 (fan speed) was exported on every layer #7094.\r\n- Fixed crashes with some models on SLA hole drilling.\r\n- Fixed \"out of print bed\" indication for objects partly below the print bed.\r\n- Disabled acceleration control if `default_acceleration` parameter is zero. The user interface already suggested this condition by graying out the per feature acceleration parameter fields with `default_acceleration` zeroed, but the G-code generator did not respect that  #3409, #6743 thanks @jschuh.\r\n- Improved fuzzy skin options wording (\"walls\" instead of \"perimeters\")  #7082, #7083, thanks @nsheridan.\r\n- Fixed confusing cooling hint when min and max fan speed are equal #3270.\r\n- Fixed variable layer editing disabled with raft enabled, this was a regression wrt. PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1 #6999.\r\n- Fixed paint on supports showing through model in certain orientations #5050.\r\n- Multi-material painting tool: Fixed incorrect propagation of bottom surfaces with objects partially below print bed #7107.\r\n- Fixed spurious \"Supports print better with detect bridging perimeters\" enabled on application start-up #6814.\r\n- Fixed incorrect estimated print time on G-code horizontal slider for MMU prints #7110.\r\n\r\n## Build, infrastructure\r\n- Updated documentation about building on Windows (thanks @jschuh, #6867)\r\n\r\n## What is in the working\r\n- Windows 10 / 11 dark mode support. There is no official dark mode support for Win32 controls by Microsoft. We worked hard to skin Win32 controls to simulate dark mode, however the skinning did not quite work for some controls and some of the skinning is now broken again on Windows 11. It seems we will be able to apply some of the hacks discovered by the [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) team to improve the dark mode.",

This alpha mostly fixes bugs found in alpha2.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha2\r\n\r\n- Painting tools (supports, seam, multimaterial) no longer use a separate undo/redo stack. Instead, the events are added into the main stack. When the painting tool is closed, all the snapshots taken during painting are compacted into one. This means that fine undo/redo is available during painting, but the main stack is not flooded with the individual events after the painting is finished.\r\n- \"New project\" and \"Load project\" actions newly clear the undo/redo stack by default, however one may revert to the old behavior by unchecking \"Clear Undo / Redo stack on new project\" in preferences #2812.\r\n- The new 'Slicing finished' notification automatically fades out after 2 seconds #7017.\r\n- The triangle mesh simplification dialog newly allows to render the model in wireframe view, which helps to better asses the achieved mesh complexity and decimation rate.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed, reported for PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha2\r\n\r\n- Fixed import of volumes from 3MFs. Repeated loading and saving gradually increased size of 3MF files containing multi-material objects or objects with modifier meshes #7011, slicing some models was broken #7039 and some models were positioned incorrectly in Z #7010. The \"inflated\" 3MFs generated by alpha2 are now being shrunk back when loaded and saved again with 2.4.0-alpha3.\r\n- Fixed import of AMF files, also broken in 2.4.0-alpha2 due to admesh eradication refactoring #7015.\r\n- The G-Code reader did not process  G28, M132 and M402 correctly, leading to issues such as shifted models in the preview. This was a regression due to G-code parser speed up #7016.\r\n- Standalone G-Code Viewer was modifying access times of G-code files loaded. This was a regression with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1 #7005.\r\n- Fixed a G-Code Viewer crash when loading G-Codes generated by SuperSlicer #7008.\r\n- SLA specific: Importing SL1 archives into PrusaSlicer did not work for SL1 archives produced by old PrusaSlicer versions, which did not store  PrusaSlicer Print / SLA material / Printer presets into the SL1 archive. Importing such SL1 archives is newly allowed, however the SLA mode needs to be active and the active Print / SLA material / Printer presets will be used #6915.\r\n- SLA resin material config option 'Correction for expansion' was not applied correctly, namely the Z correction was applied to Y axis #7013.\r\n- Fixed possible crash when an object was deleted with the simplification gizmo active.\r\n- First layer support expansion was not applied when printing without raft. This was a regression due to support refactoring in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1.\r\n- Fixed crash after a new resin was added in Configuration Wizard while an SLA printer was active.\r\n",

This alpha adds several new features and improvements and it fixes bugs found in the first alpha. The most important change is significant speed-up of the G-Code generator.\r\n\r\nTo let you enjoy the alpha without worries, the alpha builds save their profiles into PrusaSlicer-alpha directory, so you may use the alpha side by side with the current release without ruining your production configuration.\r\n\r\n## Improvements with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1\r\n\r\n- G-Code export was parallelized and optimized. This results in significant improvement of performance: The total slicing time is now 2x to 4x shorter, higher speed up is achieved on high-end CPUs #2263.\r\n- The G-Code coordinates are newly exported without emitting the leading and trailing zeros, which makes the G-code a bit smaller. While the  new G-code [conforms to standard](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=823374), it may not be consumed by some non-conforming applications #6996.\r\n-  3MFs, AMFs and OBJs are loaded considerably faster, models imported from them are no longer repaired automatically (see 'Architecture and infrastructure' below for further details)\r\n- Mesh repair statistics used to be confusing: It was not quite clear which errors were fixed during import and whether there are any errors remaining after the mesh import and repair. This has been improved: The fixed / remaining errors are newly shown clearly at the side panel and the \"exclamation mark\" icon is shown with white color for a completely fixed mesh, while an orange color is used for a not fully fixed mesh.\r\n- Bottom status bar was removed and replaced by notifications showing progress of slicing and the \"abort slicing\" button. This also solves the Windows 10 dark mode issue, where we were not able to adjust status bar colors #6860.\r\n- Windows specific: InnoCielo Meridian injects AMHook.dll into PrusaSlicer, which makes PrusaSlicer to crash. We added AMHook.dll to a blacklist so a warning dialog will be shown on startup when that DLLs is injected into PrusaSlicer #2939. This is a similar issue to the dreaded Nahimic OSD issue #6864 which we blacklisted in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1.\r\n- OSX specific: The PrusaSlicer and G-code viewer application icons were updated with the new rectangular background to match the new OSX icon style #6874 thanks @xarbit.\r\n- Windows specific: Several function calls that might have been considered suspicious by anti-virus software were replaced by alternatives. This should lower the probability that PrusaSlicer will be reported as a potential threat. #6914, thanks @jschuh\r\n- Windows specific: Selected mode button (Simple/Advanced/Expert) has now an orange background to make the active mode more distinct #6860.\r\n- The G-code preview settings at the bottom of the Preview screen are no longer resetted to their defaults after each slicing #5471.\r\n- Windows specific: 'Fix by Netfabb' can now be used on several objects at once.\r\n- Place on face no longer unifies rotation of multiple instances around their Z axes to the same angle.\r\n- The new \"Tip of the day\" notifications can now reference menu items. We use it to activate the \"Configuration Snapshots\" dialog from a \"tip of the day\".\r\n- When navigating to a configuration option from the Search dialog, the option's input field gets focus automatically #6941.\r\n- The dialog asking about unsaved changes is now shown in all scenarios when some changes in presets would be lost #6991.\r\n- The placeholder `{version}` (denoting current PrusaSlicer version) can newly be used in output filename format template string #7002.\r\n- When the \"Reload from disk\" action was called on an object for which only the source file name, not the full path to the source file name was known,  PrusaSlicer used to always ask the user to look up the source file location manually, while newly PrusaSlicer searches for the source file next to the active project file before asking the user for help.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed with respect to PrusaSlicer 2.3.3\r\n\r\n- Fixed crash when the bed texture was located in a directory that user had no permission to access #6873.\r\n- The 'Entering SLA support points' undo/redo snapshot is now taken before the gizmo is opened, not after. This bug was introduced between 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 and resulted in two identical snapshots on the undo/redo stack.\r\n- It is now possible to use Backspace to delete selected items at the object list. Delete and Backspace should now be equivalent in all contexts. The reason that Backspace is used as an alternative to Delete is that some laptops do not have the Delete key at all (some Macs, Chromebooks).\r\n- Fixed handling of \"N/A\" config options under some translations #6921.\r\n- Fixed a rare error preventing slicing of specific models #6933.\r\n- Fixed color of objects in preview for SLA printers. Until now, the color of the last filament selected in FDM mode was used.\r\n- When printing with a wipe tower, all objects are required to have the same variable layer height profile. The test for this constraint was buggy and it sometimes allowed incorrectly the slicing to continue, leading to cryptic error messages later on. This is now fixed.\r\n- When slicing was finished while the user was moving the object in the scene, it would reset the object's location. This was happening mainly with the background processing enabled #6898.\r\n- Selection rectangle in SLA support points editing mode did not work reliably when the object was rotated or scaled #4666.\r\n- The view settings combo boxes had incorrect layout the first time they were opened.\r\n- OSX specific: The items in the dialog with selection of object-specific settings to show was incorrectly stretched #6926\r\n- Linux specific: Flatpak package did not allow to export to external devices because of insufficient permission #6758, thanks @xarbit\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed crash when `$USER` environment variable was not set #3969.\r\n- Windows specific: Under certain circumstances, a system text edit box unintentionally appeared in the right panel.\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed, reported for PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1\r\n\r\n- Painted supports and seams did not work correctly on objects with multiple volumes #6863.\r\n- Fixed possible crash in the new triangle mesh simplification tool when the required number of triangles was too small.\r\n- Fixed a crash after deleting an object when simplification preview was shown.\r\n- Plater was incorrectly cleared on New Project / Open Project after the \"Do you want to save the changes to the current project\" dialog was canceled #6866.\r\n- Painted seam was broken on vertical surfaces, while it worked in PrusaSlicer 2.3.3.\r\n- 'Replace by stl' is no more allowed when some gizmo is active, which may have lead to a crash in some scenarios.\r\n- Fixed crash when enabling visualization of tool change markers in preview\r\n- Fixed crash when importing gcode generated with Simplify3D and switching to tool view.\r\n- Ajusted the wording of \"Compare presets\" pop-up windows showing differences in multi-line texts #6903.\r\n- Toolpath width in G-code Preview was clamped to 1 mm, which did not work for large nozzle diameters. The width is newly clamped to 2 mm or 4 * layer height, whatever is bigger #6828.\r\n- Fixed several drag and drop issues in object list, which appeared when some of the new rows informing about painted supports, painted seems etc. were shown.\r\n- Fixed inconsistencies of selection in scene and the object list.\r\n- Fixed deleting volumes through the right panel with the new \"Paint-on supports\", etc. items visible.\r\n- When supports are turned on with 'Detect bridging perimeters' disabled, a dialog box offering to turn it on is opened. From now on, this dialog does not have a 'Cancel' button (which was confusing) and requires strictly 'Yes' or 'No'.\r\n- When using a painting gizmo (supports/seam/multimaterial painting) with objects with modifiers, one could see inside the modifier when it was partly below the bed, which clips the bottom of it.\r\n- Print setting changes were not applied to all instances if one of the instances was rotated #6971.\r\n- Extra bridging layers were sometimes generated when the new thick_bridges option was off. #6957, thanks @jschuh for the fix.\r\n- Fixed crash when support patern spacing was set to zero #6989.\r\n- With the settings shown in a floating window, the Search did not bring back the Settings floating window if it was was minimized #6958.\r\n- Windows specific: Combo-box with preset names was too narrow with the new \"Settings tab as menu items\" enabled #6993.\r\n- G-code Preview did not update when switching to the G-code viewer for the first time after automatic background processing completed slicing #6983.\r\n- Windows-specific: Cycling through tabs using Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown was not implemented for the new custom Notebook control #6938.\r\n- Double slider was sometimes captured after certain mouse click combinations and could be moved even after the pointer no more over it.\r\n- Fixed endless loop in raft generator, which was broken for certain parameter combinations newly available in 2.4.0-alpha1.\r\n- New project was sometimes incorrectly marked as unsaved.\r\n- Retractions, deretractions and similar markers were placed at a wrong z in the gcode preview.\r\n\r\n## Architecture, infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Removed support of PRUSA files, which used to be produced by PrusaControl. PrusaControl was discontinued many years ago.\r\n- Slic3r, Slic3rPE and PrusaSlicer extensively used [admesh library](https://github.com/admesh/admesh) for internal storage and manipulation of triangle meshes. The admesh library was designed with the purpose of importing and fixing errors in STL files, while in Slic3r / PrusaSlicer admesh  was also misused as a heavy weight general triangle mesh representation and the same triangle mesh was also kept in memory using a simpler redundant \"Indexed triangle set\" representation. Starting with this release, PrusaSlicer only uses admesh for loading and fixing STL files, thus the triangle meshes are only kept using the \"Indexed triangle set\" structure, which reduces memory consumption. Triangle meshes imported from 3MFs, AMFs and OBJs are no longer repaired by admesh. For PrusaSlicer generated 3MFs it means that the triangle meshes will be loaded exactly the same way they were stored, while earlier PrusaSlicer may have modified a mesh with non-manifold edges slightly by trying to repair it each time a 3MF was loaded. For 3MFs not produced by PrusaSlicer and for AMFs and OBJs it may mean that model errors will not be fixed, however in contrary to the STL file format, the 3MF, AMF and OBJ file formats are indexed triangle sets with triangle neighborship clearly expressed by shared vertex indices, thus cracks in triangle meshes are less likely. Not repairing 3MFs through admesh considerably speeds up loading of PrusaSlicer project files.\r\n",

The [first public commit](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/55a523e1fa597923a4827c88378fb48b809367d0) is from 2011-09-01, meaning that **exactly today**, PrusaSlicer based on Slic3r celebrates its tenth birthday🎂🍾 Thanks to all who contributed during the decade and helped to continuously improve the software.\r\n\r\nComplete description of improvements and changes with respect to the current [PrusaSlicer 2.3.3 release](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/tag/version_2.3.3) follows.\r\n\r\nBecause the github Releases page clips the text to 25 thousand characters, full PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1 release log [is available at the wiki](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/wiki/PrusaSlicer-2.4.0-alpha1-full-change-log).\r\n\r\n## Multi material painting [#3535](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3535)\r\n\r\nIn PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 we have introduced paint-on supports and seams. Seeing the painting tools in PrusaSlicer, many customers asked for similar tools to help with multi material printing. Indeed, preparing models for multi material FDM prints used to be a laborious and time consuming process. With this release of PrusaSlicer, that is a thing of the past and coloring an object for multi material printing requires just a handful of bucket fill and brush stroke operations.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/131669759-8ad26d8c-2398-4f8e-a627-8071ab7207f5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">![mm_painting_jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/131669759-8ad26d8c-2398-4f8e-a627-8071ab7207f5.jpg)</a>\r\n\r\nThe editing tool opens with *N* hot key and it offers the following tools:\r\n1) Brush: similar to the old support or seam painting tool. \r\n2) Smart fill: fills a region below the mouse cursor up to a sharp edge (the sharp edge threshold is adjustable at the panel).\r\n3) Bucket fill: replace a patch of one color with another.\r\n\r\n![mmu_painting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/131332942-f927fff8-4f45-4e6a-a65f-a8e4af622fac.gif)\r\n\r\nCombo boxes in the panel allow mapping different extruders to left and right mouse button. The number and color of the selected extruder is shown for clarity. The color that is used for visualization can be overridden by clicking the colored square next to the selected extruder. This visualization color is not saved anywhere and will be lost when the application closes.\r\n\r\nOnce the object is painted, the object surface is segmented into patches of same material and the patches are extended inwards. The regions painted at the top resp. bottom surfaces are extended by the number of `top_solid_layers` resp. `bottom_solid_layers` (configurable in `Print Settings->Layers and Perimeters`). The regions painted at the side walls are expanded inwards up to maximum `mmu_segmented_region_max_width` (which is a new configuration parameter accessible in `Print Settings->Multiple Extruders->Advanced`).\r\n\r\nThe painting only affects the slicing result, the model itself is not altered and the colored \"parts\" cannot be exported separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nPlease note that thin features are not printable with FDM technolgy, thus for example painting a thin wall with two distinct colors will not make the thin wall printable. Such thin non-printable regions created during segmentation are thus detected and merged with the neighboring region, changing its color. PrusaSlicer will print thinner features with \"detect thin walls\" enabled, thus one is advised to try to enable \"detect thin walls\" if painting over thin features.\r\n\r\nThere are two extra limitations arising from technical reasons:\r\n- The multi material painting is limited to 16 extruders. If your printer uses more extruders, only the first 16 will be available in the painting tool.\r\n- Multi material painting cannot be combined with XY size compensation. The XY size compensation will be ignored during slicing if the object is also multi material painted.\r\n\r\nThe user is informed by a notification in both cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bottom layers bridges\r\n\r\nPrusaSlicer is based on the pioneering work of Alessandro Ranelucci and the RepRap community on the Slic3r project. As already mentioned above, the project was started ten years ago and a lot has changed since then indeed. The 3D printers are no more a rarity, ABS is not the only filament, motion systems are accurate and extruders are no more leaky. Thus adjustments to the slicing algorithms are called for.\r\n\r\nSlic3r's strategies of FDM supports and object over support differ from the other FDM slicers. Namely, Slic3r was designed to make use of FDM bridging capabilities to circumvent the necessity of supports. And printing bridges with ABS was not that easy: The bridges were reliable only if extruding thick strands. Combining the thick bridges with supports required the 1st layer objects being printed thicker than the other layers, leading to ugly object undersides.\r\n\r\nAll the other FDM slicers evolved differently: The first layer over supports is printed with the same flow as the other layers, thus the first layer over supports looks nicer as long as the strands bridged reliably or supported by a support interface. For support materials that do not bridge reliably, dense support is required for high quality of objects over supports.\r\n\r\nStarting with this release, PrusaSlicer newly offers printing bridges and 1st object layers over supports with the default layer thickness. The bridging behavior is configurable with a new \"thick_bridges\" boolean option. If enabled, the old Slic3r bridging strategy is applied, while if disabled, bridging is performed in a similar fashion to the other FDM slicers, leading to better bottom quality over supports. With \"thick_bridges\" disabled, the behavior of \"bridge_flow_ratio\" changes: Instead of modifying cross section of a rounded extrusion while keeping the gap between the extrusion threads constant, extrusion spacing is maintained while modifying the extrusion width and / or height to reach the prescribed extrusion ratio.\r\n\r\n![thick_bridges](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130222466-686942dc-7d52-4dfa-b35c-e3640897445b.jpg)\r\n\r\n## FDM supports improvements\r\n\r\nFDM supports were substantially redesigned in this release, answering frequent (and rightful) complaints from the users:\r\n\r\n1. New \"snug\" shape of the support columns. By default, PrusaSlicer projects support columns into a regular grid for stability. Supports projected into a regular grid have a well defined minimum area, however they tend to leak out of regions they support along the object walls down to the print bed. We newly implement \"snug\" supports, which maintain the shape of the supported overhangs, thus avoiding the leaks with the trade-off of possibly lower support stability [#555](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/555) [#740](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/740) [#902](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/902) [#1346](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1346) [#1993](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1993) [#2708](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2708) [#3083](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3083) [#4783](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4783) [#6240](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6240).\r\nThe support shape is configured with a new \"support_material_style\" config field, which accepts two values: \"grid\" (the old behavior) vs. \"snug\" (the new shape). The \"snug\" supports accept a new parameter \"support_material_closing_radius\", which controls merging close support islands and simplification of the support column shape. We borrowed a function `smooth_outward()` from Cura written by [@BagelOrb](http://github.com/BagelOrb) to robustly simplify support island contours during merging of multiple support overhang islands.\r\n![snug_vs_grid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/131343684-d0ce9322-b26b-4c7a-a23d-ee82a0310138.jpg)\r\n2. If \"support on build plate only\" is enabled, the support columns are newly trimmed to not land on top of an object. However this may make the column too small to be stable [#915](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/915) [#1340](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1340) [#3980](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3980) [#4199](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4199).\r\n3. Support enforcers newly take precedence over \"supports on build plate only\" and over \"don't support bridges\". This applies to both the enforcer and blocker modifier meshes and paint-on supports. Also the fact that the enforcers take precedence over blockers is indicated by sorting the enforcer meshes below the blocker modifiers at the side panel (the volume lower in the list always takes precedence over a volume upper in the list) [#1870](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1870) [#1997](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1997) [#2801](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2801) [#3741](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3741) [#3831](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3831) [#5105](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5105) [#5748](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5748).\r\n4. A new configuration value \"support_material_bottom_contact_distance\" has been added to complement \"support_material_contact_distance\". If \"support_material_bottom_contact_distance\" is positive, it defines separation gap between the object top surfaces and bottom of support towers, while \"support_material_contact_distance\" defines gap between the support and object bottom surfaces. If \"support_material_bottom_contact_distance\" is set to zero, the old \"support_material_contact_distance\" applies to both top and bottom distances.\r\n5. Similarly, a new configuration value \"support_material_bottom_interface_layers\" has been added to complement \"support_material_interface_layers\". If \"support_material_bottom_interface_layers\" is non negative, it defines number of dense support interface layers between the object top surfaces and bottom of support towers, while \"support_material_interface_layers\" defines number of dense support interface layers between the support and object bottom surfaces. If \"support_material_bottom_interface_layers\" is set to \"same as top\" (value -1), the old \"support_material_interface_layers\" is used to define both. If \"support_material_interface_layers\" is set to zero, neither top nor bottom support interface layers are being created [#4288](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4288).\r\n6. The support 1st layer density and expansion is newly configurable with \"raft_first_layer_density\" and \"raft_first_layer_expansion\", allowing to disable support 1st layer expansion completely. While the two configuration values start with \"raft_\", they are applied to the 1st support layer if the raft is disabled [#1165](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1165) [#2568](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2568) [#3772](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3772).\r\n7. The support interface pattern is newly configurable with \"support_material_interface_pattern\" to \"default\", \"rectilinear\" and \"concentric\". Default is concentric for soluble interfaces and rectilinear for non-soluble support interfaces. We expect this settings to be useful for printing with soluble interfaces: While the concentric pattern may produce smoother surfaces at sides of an object, rectilinear support interface may produce nicer horizontal surfaces [#1197](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1197).\r\n8. Improved soluble support interfaces over non-soluble support base columns ([#5823](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5823)). Printing a soluble interface directly over non-soluble sparse support is not a good idea. Soluble support material often does not stick properly to non-soluble material and the soluble material may not bridge the gaps between sparse support lines. Based on [#5903](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5903) by [@spiky2021](http://github.com/spiky2021), PrusaSlicer newly extrudes half of the support interface layers with the support base material, so that the dense soluble support interface material is extruded over a dense base interface material layer. While the soluble interface pattern is now configurable with \"support_material_interface_pattern\", the non-soluble dense interface is always extruded with rectilinear pattern, which bridges better over the sparse support.\r\n9. The FDM sparse zig-zag infill algorithm was redesigned to support dense support interface layers reliably [#2969](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2969) [#4295](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4295) [#4951](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4951).\r\n10. Brim is newly calculated around the object, not around the 1st layer of the support and supports are printed over the brim on other layers [#713](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/713) [#1156](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1156) [#3395](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3395) [#3396](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3396).\r\n11. A single perimeter line is newly extruded around the support 1st layer to improve print bed adhesion [#756](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/756) [#2101](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2101).\r\n12. Support first layer used to be printed with concentric pattern for soluble materials, it is newly printed with rectilinear infill all the time [#684](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/684) [#1445](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1445).\r\n13. UI related, paint-on supports: Extra dialog for auto setting by angle gizmo was removed, the slider is now embedded in the main paint-on supports gizmo dialog.\r\n\r\n\r\n## FDM support generator bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed spilling of FDM supports using the old \"grid\" support style due to some numerical inaccuracy issues [#5209](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5209) [#6067](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6067).\r\n- Reduced leakage of FDM supports using the old \"grid\" support style through object holes. The leakage was significant with thin walled objects. Newly the supports are only allowed to fill a grid cell, never to expand into a neighboring support grid cells, and the risk of leakage through thin walls was reduced by over-sampling the support grid [#5054](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5054).\r\n\r\n![supports_leakage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130204988-4c26258e-be50-4291-bdeb-196e44776025.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Fixed excessive cooling slow down over supports. Cooling was incorrectly calculated from the time to print a support layer when the support layer was printed at its own Z height. PrusaSlicer may print a support layer at its own Z height not synchronized with any other object print Z height to guarantee the support contact Z distance. As the cooling slow down was incorrectly applied to each layer independently, a support only layer and the successive object layer were slowed down unnecessarily. Newly PrusaSlicer applies a cooling slow down logic to all support layers together with the object layer being supported [#984](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/984).\r\n- Fixed paint-on supports on horizontal surfaces, where the painted regions were assigned incorrectly to one layer below or one layer above the painted regions due to numerical issues [#5948](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5948).\r\n- Fixed excessive 1st layer support raft expansion. PrusaSlicer used to fill holes in the 1st layer support raft on purpose to improve adhesion, however this behavior was found too aggressive. Filling holes in the support 1st layer is disabled now while the user may newly apply a higher raft_expansion if one wants a stronger 1st layer adhesion [#430](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/430).\r\n- Fixed leakage of 1st layer support raft through thin object walls during the 1st layer support raft expansion. The 1st layer support raft is newly expanded carefully with multiple steps to avoid the leakage [#2245](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2245).\r\n- Fixed unnecessary support interafaces created by aggressively merging concentric support interfaces [#4570](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4570).\r\n- Re-enabled \"Enforce support for first N layers\" even if \"Generate supports\" is disabled [#470](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/470).\r\n\r\n## FDM Raft enhancements [#1277](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1277) [#2823](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2823) [#3425](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3425) [#6053](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6053)\r\n\r\n- The raft newly supports separate configuration of \"raft_contact_z_distance\". Indeed, we want the \"raft_contact_z_distance\" to be smaller than \"contact_z_distance\", as we value the quality of the 1st object layer over raft interface and it is easy to remove raft with a blade. \r\n- \"raft_expansion\" is newly configurable.\r\n- First object layer above the raft interface is no more printed with a bridging flow, but a normal flow. This produces much nicer bottom object surface.\r\n- Because the first object layer above the raft interface is no more printed with a bridging flow, the bottom infill pattern is newly respected [#3507](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3507).\r\n- Speed and acceleration of first object layer above the raft interface is newly configurable with \"first_layer_speed_over_raft\" and \"first_layer_acceleration_over_raft\" [#6166](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6166) [#6623](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6623).\r\n\r\nThe raft rework is based on [#6003](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6003) thanks [@nemart69](http://github.com/nemart69) for the contribution.\r\n\r\n## First layer height\r\n\r\nThe following properties of the FDM support generator changed:\r\n- The \"first_layer_height\" parameter was made global to the print, it is no more object specific. We consider the 1st layer height to be a property of the print. Also the skirt and brim are calculated and printed for multiple objects in a single step, therefore allowing different 1st layer height for different objects was questionable from the start.\r\n- Because now first_layer_height is print specific, the \"first_layer_height\" no more supports relative values with respect to object layer height. Thus \"first_layer_height\" defined relative to the object layer height is newly converted to an absolute value when importing a config file or a project file.\r\n\r\n## Brim and skirt enhancements\r\n\r\n### Inner brims, brim per object\r\n\r\nPrevious PrusaSlicer versions only generated outer brim, leaving any possible holes in the first layer without brim and forcing users to use workarounds using extra thin object parts etc. Starting with this release, it is possible to generate outer brims, inner brims or both.\r\n\r\nAlso, brim settings are now object specific and brim is not generated for all objects at once, but for each of them separately. This allows to turn brim on just for some of the objects, use different brim width for individual objects etc.\r\n[#286](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/286)\r\n[#651](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/651)\r\n[#1033](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1033)\r\n[#2182](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2182)\r\n[#2290](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2290)\r\n[#2455](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2455)\r\n\r\n### Brim and elephant foot compensation, configurable brim offset\r\n\r\nPurpose of the brim is to increase adhesion of the object to the print bed, meaning that it must be fused to the object. On the other hand, it must be possible to remove the brim without damaging the object itself. This means that the gap between the object and the brim must be chosen carefully. This issue is further alleviated by elephant foot effect, always present on the first layer of a print.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, elephant foot compensation (EFC) was applied on the first layer of the object, while the brim was left as if no EFC was applied. This leads to a small gap between the object and the innermost loop of the brim, which should be filled due to the elephant foot effect. However, this made the actual sticking of the brim quite sensitive to z-height adjustment of the nozzle and sometimes led to inadequate attachment of the brim to the object.\r\n\r\nStarting with this release, the brim is generated after EFC of the object. The offset of the brim can be further adjusted by a new configuration parameter \"brim_separation\" (which is independent on EFC), allowing the user to fine tune the brim offset to his or her liking.\r\n[#4850](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4850)\r\n[#3779](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3779)\r\n\r\nAs long as brim offset is set to zero, the EFC should never detach the brim from the object.\r\n[#3870](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3870)\r\n[#6795](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6795)\r\n[#4736](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4736)\r\n[#3949](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3949)\r\n[#3915](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3915)\r\n[#4736](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4736)\r\n[#6602](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6602)\r\n\r\nWhen loading a project file (3MF) stored by earlier PrusaSlicer version, the \"brim_separation\" value is set equal to the elephant foot compensation value to produce the same brim as was created with the PrusaSlicer that saved that project file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Draft shield\r\nSkirt printed around the printed objects is present in PrusaSlicer for years (and it was in original Slic3r before). There are several uses the skirt can serve and that people use it for. Priming of the nozzle at the beginning of the print, priming after a toolchange, or using a very high skirt as a draft shield are the most usual. Skirt is a multi-purpose tool and this release brings several changes in its configuration and behavior to make its use more intuitive (especially regarding its usage combined with a brim).\r\n\r\nThe old boolean configuration option \"draft_shield\" is now an enum and allows following selection:\r\n- Disabled: the skirt is not used as a draft shield, it is printed around all objects' brims to the specified height\r\n- Limited: the skirt is as close to the objects as specified by \"skirt_distance\" (possibly intersecting brims), it is built to the specified height (\"skirt_height\")\r\n- Enabled: same as 'Limited', except \"skirt_height\" is ignored and the skirt is as tall as the tallest object\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130232225-26c9b9e4-acd6-4f9f-9af9-640c7b462df2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">![draft_shield](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130232225-26c9b9e4-acd6-4f9f-9af9-640c7b462df2.jpg)</a>\r\n\r\nThis allows the brim to improve draft shield print bed adhesion and to push the draft shield as close to the object as possible, while not creating any skirt/brim intersections when the user does not intend to use skirt in place of a draft shield.\r\n[#4802](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4802)\r\n[#5056](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5056)\r\n[#4736](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4736)\r\n[#3692](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3692)\r\n[#6544](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6544)\r\n\r\nWhen draft shield is used, skirt loops are printed uninterrupted and brim loops are cut. While it may make more sense to do it the other way round, shortening skirt is unacceptable because of \"min_skirt_length\" parameter and possible usage for nozzle purging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Negative volumes, modifier & extruder override rules\r\n\r\nPrusaSlicer newly supports \"negative volumes\" to subtract pieces of geometry from a model [#4920](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4920). While there was a way to achieve a similar effect by setting zero number of top / bottom layers, zero perimeters and no infill in earlier versions of PrusaSlicer, the new \"negative volumes\" are much easier to use and they are processed faster and the old workaround produced artifacts as in [#5095](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5095). Read more in the [Documentation](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/negative-volume_238503).\r\n\r\n![negative_volume_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/129907204-afc59df9-32e7-40fe-9861-e1c31f9aeeb7.jpg)\r\n\r\nPrusaSlicer newly clips the volumes and applies the modifiers in the order they are presented at the side panel, latter volume clipping the former one, latter modifier overriding the former modifier or volume. The configuration values applied to objects, volumes and modifiers are newly collected in the following order: \r\n1) Global parameters\r\n2) Object parameters\r\n3) Volume parameters\r\n4) Layer range parameters\r\n5) Modifier parameters\r\n6) Extruder ID by Multi-material painting\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change, where in earlier PrusaSlicer versions modifier parameters were applied over object parameters, ignoring parameters of volumes, layer range modifiers and other modifier meshes with which they overlap [#5986](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5986). This was particularly painful for multi-material prints, where an application of a modifier mesh to set an infill rate resetted the extruder ID to the object default one [#2657](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2657) [#3012](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3012) [#6091](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6091). Also newly a \"Default\" extruder assigned to a modifier mesh or a layer range modifier does not change the extruder of the underlying geometry.\r\n\r\nMutual clipping of multi-material volumes newly respects the order at the object list while in the earlier PrusaSlicer versions the volumes were first grouped by an extruder ID and then clipped [#3272](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3272) [#3318](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3318) [#4114](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4114) [#5831](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5831). Please note that the clipping order was changed as well: The latter volume newly clips the former volume. This is a breaking change, however we believe it is worth it as the new order is natural especially for the chaining of modifier attributes.\r\n\r\nFollowing bugs were fixed during the refactoring:\r\n- Modifiers applied over an object with contour simplification (parameter 'resolution') produced gaps inside an object along the modifier boundary [#6451](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6451) thanks [@supermerill](http://github.com/supermerill) for pointing out the issue.\r\n\r\n## Fuzzy skin [#2010](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2010)\r\n\r\nWe have ported the popular Fuzzy Skin feature of Cura into PrusaSlicer, thanks Cura team for keeping Cura open source. The Fuzzy Skin feature in PrusaSlicer works the same as in Cura: Fuzzification is applied to external perimeters only, hole perimeters may or may not be fuzzified. The perimeter is being resampled with a random step size and each new sample point is being shifted inside or outside of the perimeter by a random length. This simple algorithm produces surprisingly nice results suitable for tool handles or just to give the print surface a new interesting look or to hide print imprecisions. Read more in the [Documentation](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/fuzzy-skin_246186).\r\n\r\n![fuzzy_skin_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/129725728-a9188f65-c147-4b54-a745-46f471d57cc8.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Multi-material wipe tower\r\n\r\n- Soluble filament is known to not bind to other materials well. Thus for the wipe tower stability, PrusaSlicer newly does not use soluble filament for wipe tower perimeters or wipe tower sparse infill [#1948](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1948).\r\n- Soluble filament is known to not bridge well. Thus PrusaSlicer newly never wipes a soluble filament over a sparse wipe tower, but it prints a dense layer of non-soluble filament at the layer below for the soluble filament to stick to [#2818](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2818).\r\n- Wipe tower first layer is newly printed with non-soluble material if possible by reordering the 1st layer extrusions to start with the soluble material, thus the soluble material will not be purged at the 1st layer [#3953](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3953).\r\n- Fixed an issue where the travel speed was not used when moving from a custom tool change position to the wipe tower [#5483](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5483).\r\n- Wipe tower 1st layer is newly extruded with first_layer_speed.\r\n- Improved placement of extruder priming regions on circular beds [#6459](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6459).\r\n- Before moving to the wipe tower, filament is newly retracted using a normal retraction length, while it was retracted using the tool change retraction length before.\r\n- Wipe tower brim width is newly adjustable.\r\n\r\n## Support for [3DLabPrint](https://3dlabprint.com/) airplane models\r\n\r\nPrusaSlicer newly supports slicing of 3DLabPrint airplane models. These 3DLabPrint models were designed to be sliced with Simplify3D with a single perimeter and no infill to produce a single perimeter wing surface reinforced by single perimeter ribs. From the solid geometry point of view, these models contain overlapping bodies, thus they are not valid solid models. After the model is sliced, polygons in each layer are merged and further processed with a [Clipper](http://angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) library by most of the FDM slicers, including PrusaSlicer, Cura and most likely by the closed source Simplify3D as well, however the slicers differ in what [fill rule](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/Units/ClipperLib/Types/PolyFillType.htm) they apply by default. Simplify3D always uses the Even-Odd fill rule, while Cura and PrusaSlicer use the Positive fill rule by default. To allow slicing the 3DLabPrint models, PrusaSlicer implements a new \"Slicing Mode\" option, allowing one to switch between the \"Positive\" (default) and \"Even / Odd\" rule. Yet another new \"Slicing Mode\" option \"Close Holes\" makes PrusaSlicer to fill in all internal structures [#3062](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3062) [#3708](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3708).\r\n\r\n## Sequential print\r\n\r\n- When sequential print is active, there is always a risk that the print head will hit some of the objects. It is possible to set extruder clearance distance and height so that PrusaSlicer would check for possible collision. The clearance areas are now also visualized in the scene when moving objects around and in case of a collision [#4195](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4195).\r\n\r\n![seq_print_limits](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130093984-316bb4b7-38b8-465e-a9d9-5bc133bf575a.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Because we do not support Color Print with sequential print, we newly indicate the fact by showing the \"Color Print\" icon at the vertical slider of the G-code viewer grayed out and we also newly show a tooltip explaining why the action is not available [#5437](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5437).\r\n- Aligned seam did not work correctly when printing sequentially [bd2cbea](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/bd2cbea202b459cfdfa17389dfa27b9b033f3954)\r\n\r\n## G-code generator, firmware flavors\r\n\r\n### Support of modern Marlin firmware\r\n\r\nPrusa's MK2 and MK3 printer firmware is running on an 8-bit Atmel microcontroller and it is based on a heavily modified legacy Marlin, while the Prusa3D Mini printer and our upcoming 3D printer models are equipped with 32 bit boards running Marlin 2 as a motion controller. Until now, PrusaSlicer produced G-code for the legacy Marlin firmware only. We newly split the Marlin firmware flavor to 'Marlin (legacy)' and 'Marlin 2' to be able to support new Marlin 2 features, above all the more fine grained acceleration control, separating the acceleration while traveling from acceleration while extruding [#1089](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1089) [#1994](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1994) [#6457](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6457).\r\n\r\nWith the 'Marlin (legacy)' firmware flavor active, M204 Pa Rb Ta is emitted at the G-code preamble, where a, b are the values from machine limits, while M204 S... is emitted for feature type dependent acceleration settings.\r\nWith the 'Marlin 2' firmware flavor active, M204 Pa Rb Tc is emitted at the G-code preamble, where a, b, c are the values from machine limits, while M204 P... is emitted for feature type dependent acceleration settings, not overriding the travel acceleration.\r\n\r\n### Other new features\r\n- Added new parameter to enable / disable gap fill. Until now one was able to disable gap fill by setting gap fill speed to zero, which was counter intuitive [#2956](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2956) [#5999](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5999) thanks [@xorza](http://github.com/xorza).\r\n- One may newly set the travel speed for the Z axis independently from travel speed in other axes. The new \"travel_speed_z\" configuration value defaults to zero, meaning that the \"travel_speed\" is used instead, thus being backward compatible with the old profiles and project files [#2945](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2945) [#3995](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3995) [#6365](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6365) [#6369](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6369) thanks [@martinbudden](http://github.com/martinbudden).\r\n- RepRapFirmware specific: Use \"M204 P\" instead of \"M204 S\" to control acceleration\r\n[#5740](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5740)\r\nthanks [@rsobik](http://github.com/rsobik).\r\n- PrusaSlicer newly generates M73 code with the remaining times to the next color change or pause print event. The remaining time G-code M73 has been extended with two new remaining times: Cxx and Dxx for normal vs. stealth (silent) printer mode.\r\n- Added macro processing of color_change_gcode, pause_print_gcode and template_custom_gcode custom G-codes when emitting them into the output G-code.\r\n[#5782](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5782)\r\n- Added new placeholder for custom tool change gcode (toolchange_z), which provides Z coordinate of the tool change at the top of a wipe tower, while layer_z provides the Z coordinate of the last object layer printed. The two Z coordinates differ in case the wipe tower was generated without sparse layers\r\n[#3834](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3834).\r\n- G-code post-processor is newly executed before the G-code is copied to the target location. Indeed, running a post-processing script on SD card is not a good idea. Please note that the G-code viewer still visualizes G-code before post-processing\r\n[#6000](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6000) thanks [@xorza](http://github.com/xorza).\r\n- G-code post-processor framework has been extended: [#6042](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6042)\r\n    1) New environment variable SLIC3R_PP_HOST contains one of \"File\", \"PrusaLink\", \"Repetier\", \"SL1Host\", \"OctoPrint\", \"FlashAir\", \"Duet\", \"AstroBox\" ...\r\n    2) New environment variable SLIC3R_PP_OUTPUT_NAME contains the name of the G-code file including path (for SLIC3R_PP_HOST == \"File\") or a name that will be given to the file after it is upload to the host (PrusaLink, Octoprint ...)\r\n    3) The post-processing script may suggest a new output file name (likely based on SLIC3R_PP_OUTPUT_NAME) by saving it as a single line into a new \"output name\" temp file. The \"output name\" file name is created by suffixing the input G-code file name with \".output_name\".\r\n- Configuration stored into G-code is newly delimited with \"; prusaslicer_config = begin\" and \"; prusaslicer_config = end\". These delimiters look like any other key / value configuration pairs on purpose to be compatible with older PrusaSlicer versions trying to parse configuration from G-code. The G-code viewer reads the \"; generated by PrusaSlicer ....\" header and if the G-code was generated by PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha0 and newer, it expects that the configuration block is enclosed by the new delimiters. This makes the G-code parser more robust going forward and G-codes can now be loaded by the G-code viewer even if an OctoPrint plugin adds its own comments at the end of the G-code after PrusaSlicer's configuration\r\n[#6730](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6730).\r\n\r\n### The following G-code generator bugs were fixed:\r\n- PrusaSlicer emits various annotations for its own use, namely to augment the G-code for viewing. For example, layer height could not be guessed from the G-code reliably for bridges or for layers over supports, thus PrusaSlicer emits \";HEIGHT:xxx\" when the current layer height changes. There is a risk however, that the user may enter the same annotation into some of the custom G-code block thus confusing the G-code viewer. The PrusaSlicer newly checks for the reserved comments in custom G-codes and isses a warning both when such a G-code comment is entered into custom G-code parameter and when a G-code is produced using such a questionable custom G-code block\r\n[#5538](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5538).\r\n- Fixed an issue in \"avoid crossing perimeters\" with the extruder wipe enabled, where there were unnecessary travels produced in the opposite direction of the wipe travel\r\n[8f293f0](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/8f293f0cb560b80b6ace68d1febdb026b379097f).\r\n[613f961](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/613f961b9fab7fb5515644d49585fd3447079e5a)\r\n- Fixed a bug in fan speed ramp up formula\r\n[#5893](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5893).\r\n- Fixed initialization of the random number generator for the custom G-code macro processor [#5219(comment)](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/pull/5219#issuecomment-794515454).\r\n- Fixed first layer slow down in case the \"autospeed\" feature was enabled. Fix merged from upstream slic3r, thanks [@alranel](http://github.com/alranel)\r\n[#5829](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5829).\r\n- Fixed hang-up with very low infill rates due to rounding to zero followed by a division by zero\r\n[#5910](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5910).\r\n- Reworked the skirt generator to generate skirt just at non-empty layers (layers that actually extrude object or support) and to respect minimum layer height. Skirt generator stops at the first layer where those two conditions cannot be met simultaneously.\r\n[#5652](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5652).\r\n- Fixed unnecessary splitting of solid fill surfaces. This was a regression issue introduced in PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 during the implementation of infill anchoring\r\n[#4437](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4437)\r\n[#5988](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5988).\r\n- Fixed application of painted seams in case the painted triangles were strictly vertical.\r\n- Fixed \"Iron all surfaces\" feature\r\n[#5703](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5703).\r\n- Fixed G-code export for \"No extrusion\" firmware flavor by not emitting the E axis. The fix is partial as no extrusions are shown by the final G-code preview\r\n[#6023](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6023).\r\n- Fixed unreliable application of filament overrides to custom G-code sections. Sometimes the main config value was used instead of a filament override and vice versa [#3649](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3649).\r\n\r\n## G-code viewer improvements\r\n\r\n### The following new features were implemented for the G-code viewer:\r\n\r\n- The G-code newly supports visualization of seams\r\n[#6755](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6755). \r\n- The G-code viewer also newly supports visualization of the G-code snippet centered around the active G-code line. The G-code snippet is shown once the extruder position is moved using the horizontal slider.\r\n- A current G-code line number is now shown now at the horizontal slider instead of an index of a move\r\n[#5611](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5611).\r\n- Extrusions produced by the custom start G-code were not visualized as extrusions, but as travel lines. They are newly displayed correctly as custom extrusions and they are visualized as if extruded at the 1st layer independent of their Z position and extrusion height.\r\n- The G-code may be newly colored by the temperature of the active extruder\r\n[#4402](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4402)\r\n[#6106](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6106)\r\nthanks [@combolek](http://github.com/combolek).\r\n- The printing time of the first layer is newly available at the G-code legend\r\n[#5763](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5763).\r\n- Filament used (length and weight) per extruder and per Color Change interval is newly shown at the G-code legend\r\n[#2825](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2825)\r\n[#5980](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5980).\r\n- The G-code legend may not fit small screens, thus it has newly been made scrollable.\r\n\r\n### The following bugs were fixed:\r\n\r\n- The used filament weight and cost are newly correctly shown for PrusaSlicer generated G-codes by the stand-alone G-code viewer by parsing the filament density and cost from the G-code config section.\r\n- Prusa's own G-codes Tc, Tx and T? specific to Multi Material Upgrade (MMU) no more produce warnings to the console\r\n[#6006](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6006).\r\n- PrusaSlicer generated G-codes are now imported correctly even if the G-code is prefixed with an additional header, for example generated by ArcWelder\r\n[#6117](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6117).\r\n- Extended the G-code processor to read G28 (move to origin)\r\n[#5843](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5843).\r\n- Improved compatibility with newer Simplify3D G-codes by extracting the print bed size from their G-code.\r\n- Similar to the Marlin 2 firmware, RepRapFirmware expects M204 P instead of M204 S to set the acceleration while extruding\r\n[#5599](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5599)\r\n[#5740](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5740)\r\nthanks [@rsobik](http://github.com/rsobik).\r\n- Fixed configuration pop-up menu of the horizontal slider - enabling / disabling \"Show estimated time\" and \"Show object height\" did not work correctly\r\n[#6650](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6650).\r\n- Multi-material specific: Horizontal slider did not work correctly with \"No sparse layers\" enabled for the wipe tower, where the wipe tower layers are not necessarily extruded at the same height as object layers. This is now solved by starting a new \"layer\" at the vertical scroll bar every time the print Z changes (Z is lowered down to a sparse wipe tower or Z goes up back to top of an object)\r\n[#6232](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6232).\r\n- Improved parsing of Simplify3D G-code: Filament densities and diameters are newly extracted, allowing us to calculate used filament length and weight for S3D G-codes\r\n[a2788f3](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/a2788f3a7338ac387a4872b92b66471bb7b7f3e6).\r\n\r\n## Arrangement, SLA auto-orientation\r\n\r\n- Arrangement will now search for suitable rotation when arranging items larger than the bed [49c6ce7](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/49c6ce76d0552112855067822f6a435d8a0b9797)\r\n- Arrangement ignores objects which can't fit into a single bed, the user is notified when it happens [c30ac4b](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/c30ac4b66fc26c1d1ab09295b5bfaa72867716f7)\r\n- In PrusaSlicer 2.3.0 we have changed the SLA auto-orientation algorithm. Some users were not happy about the change, thus we newly provide a configuration dialog at the Rotate gizmo allowing one to select the auto-orientation algorithm. [#5714](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5714)\r\n\r\n![optimize_orientation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/131351207-8de31ec9-d3ca-4572-a8e1-a0d242527618.jpg)\r\n\r\n## SLA improvements and bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Cancellation of slicing was very slow when attempted during rasterization step. This should now be fixed.\r\n[#6253](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6253)\r\n- Exporting STL function no longer produces inverted normals when mirroring is applied\r\n[#6406](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6406)\r\n[978b359](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/978b3594926cfcd7f0dfe343999f43abbde526b1)\r\n- SLA preview now does not show full object when slider is at 1st layer\r\n[c54ce89](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/c54ce89883294661c4d050cbfa85f1a17e4c3077)\r\n- Trimming after hollowing in SLA mode\r\n[e57eca0](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/e57eca0289e2f5e3e6bb2f6d6fa53e0fc48987c3)\r\n[82954ba](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/82954ba7152dc05f76445614e17ed97edbe0091e)\r\n- SLA Drill holes are now drilled one by one and a warning is displayed when the operation fails. This will hopefully increase robustness when dealing with complicated or broken meshes.\r\n[4b9de03](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/4b9de0398fae01b45cdfc739f8a6c91533357672) ..

That is, it did not track whether current plater contents was modified since it was loaded etc. This led to desperate moments when a user closed the application and instead of being asked about unsaved changes, they would all be discarded without a warning.\r\n\r\nThis release introduces this concept of edited project. When a 3MF is loaded and the objects are modified, an asterisk is shown in the title bar as an indication of unchanged changes in the project. This disappears after the changes are saved. Attempting to close the application, to open another project etc will open a dialog about whether the changes should be saved first.\r\n\r\nThe currently edited project is reset to an empty project when a new project is created (`File->New Project`). A confirmation dialog is shown when there are unsaved changes in current project. While the plater content is still recoverable by Undo after opening a new project, the link to the previously opened project will **not** be recovered and the objects will be considered as parts of the new (unsaved) project. The same applies to 'Undo/redo', i.e., it undoes the action but does not change the correspondence to a project, so when you for example open project1, move object, open project2, undo and save, the content of project1 will be saved into project2. Also, creating New Project does not affect modified profiles.\r\n\r\nModifying configuration parameters in selected profiles is also considered as a change in the currently active project. When attempting to close the application with such an unsaved change, the user would again be asked whether to save the project. In case they select 'Yes', the modified profile will be saved into the 3MF and the application will close. However, answering 'No' will close the unsaved project and the \"Unsaved changes dialog\" (introduced in [PrusaSlicer 2.3.0](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases/version_2.3.0-alpha1)) will pop-up asking whether the modification of the profile should be saved (not into the 3MF, but into the profile).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Moving the object below the print bed [#1513](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1513)\r\n\r\nWe are newly allowing an object to be moved below the print bed to print just the part of the object above the print bed. Arguably this was already doable with the \"Cut\" tool, but the new way is much simpler to use and very handy for example if one just needs to flatten the bottom of an uneven object to be printable without a raft. We do not allow the object to be lifted above the print bed: Elevated objects are not printable without a raft and supports. If an object is not flat, raft shall be enabled for the object by the user. \r\n\r\nAn object is either on the print bed or below the print bed. If an object is on the print bed, the software behaves as before: After rotating and scaling, the object Z position is adjusted to touch the print bed. On the other hand, if an object is partially below the print bed, scaling and rotation does not change object's Z position as long as the object is not elevated above the print bed. If an object is elevated above the print bed, it is again lowered to touch the print bed. There is also a new button \"Drop to bed\" at the object manipulation panel to move the object back to the print bed, however the same action may be done just by elevating the object above the print bed with the move gizmo and letting it drop back to the print bed.\r\n\r\nIf the object is partially below the print bed, a white contour is drawn along the object - print bed intersection to indicate where the object will be trimmed. When manipulating the object with a move / rotate / scale gizmos or when hovering over the object with a mouse cursor, the white intersection contour is drawn not clipped by the object to make it easier to flatten an uneven bottom of an object.\r\n\r\nWhen in painting gizmo, the part below the print bed is being clipped and painting on the print bed clipping plane is not allowed.\r\n\r\nMoving objects below print bed is not allowed in SLA mode for now as it would make the placement of SLA supports confusing. Thus when switching from an FDM printer to a SLA printer, all objects below the print bed are being lifted to touch the print bed.\r\n\r\n## Automatic Color Print for signs\r\n\r\nAfter slicing a sign object, a notification is newly shown in the G-Code preview informing that the object looks like a sign and that one may want to use the Color Print feature to manually switch the filament. If one agrees with the suggestion by clicking on the notification hyperlink, the color change events are inserted into the vertical scroll bar.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130228647-55289826-12bb-4d7b-9205-0f08002ce306.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">![auto_color_change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/130228647-55289826-12bb-4d7b-9205-0f08002ce306.jpg)</a>\r\n\r\nThis feature was proposed by [@richrap](http://github.com/richrap), thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Shape Gallery [#6703](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6703)\r\n\r\nWe have implemented a Shape Gallery offering both system shapes distributed with PrusaSlicer installation and user shapes installed into user's configuration directory. The Shape Gallery could be used to insert a shape on the plater, as an additional part of an object or as a modifier similarly to how a built in shape (cube, cylinder, sphere) has been inserted by earlier PrusaSlicers. The Shape Gallery could be used for example to emboss a recycling code to the bottom of an object [#4349](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4349), for loading Mickeymouse brims to augment brims etc. STL and OBJ files may be loaded by the \"Add\" button or by drag & dropping into the Gallery window. A thumbnail is generated for a user shape automatically, which is saved as an PNG image file, however the user may want to replace the generated thumbnail image with her/his own.\r\n\r\nThe Shape Galery is not available in Simple mode.\r\n\r\n## Windows Dark Mode [#4493](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4493)\r\n\r\nBased on the popular request, we have implemented Dark Mode for Windows and we have also fixed the High Contrast mode [#3038](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3038).\r\n\r\nWhile PrusaSlicer supports dark mode on OSX and Linux for some time already, Dark Mode on Windows was the one from the hard basket. PrusaSlicer's user interface is implemented using a [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) multi-platform library, which wraps around the native controls the platform provides. On Windows, wxWidgets wrap around the aging Win32 controls, for which there is no official Dark Mode support provided by Microsoft since the introduction of the Dark Mode into Windows 10 in fall 2018. Unfortunately Microsoft just implemented an undocumented API for the controls used by Windows Explorer to switch to Dark Mode. If a Win32 control is not used by Windows Explorer main window, it is not Dark Moded and it never will be, and the API for those controls that are supported is not official, thus it may be changed without notice.\r\n\r\nWe have done our best using the undocumented Dark Mode API and skinning of Win32 controls. We even implemented our own replacements for some Win32 controls, which were not skinnable, for example the tabbed notebook that we use to switch between the Plater / Print / Filament / Printer profiles (this one fixes speed of switching the tabs on 4k displays [#6309](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6309)). Still some of the controls are not skinned properly, for example the scroll bars, status bar or the spin control buttons, thus PrusaSlicer may not look quite polished in Dark Mode. Therefore for now we decided to not switch PrusaSlicer into Dark Mode following the Windows system settings, but we are letting the user to select dark mode from Preferences using the \"Use Dark color mode (experimental)\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nWe were inspired by the [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) effort, which released its Dark Moded version just recently. We are using source code borrowed from Notepad++ interfacing with the unpublished Dark Mode API, which is based on [this project](https://github.com/ysc3839/win32-darkmode). As far as we are aware of, Notepad++ is the only Win32 open source application which implements Dark Mode to a reasonable extent. \r\n\r\nAs an alternative to the \"tabbed notebook\" control to switch between the Plater / Print / Filament / Printer profiles, we newly allow these tabs to be placed into the application menu, which may be welcome on small laptop screens.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/129917501-982377a9-6a8e-4d7f-851b-3c2c3ee66a12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">![windows_dark_mode_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/129917501-982377a9-6a8e-4d7f-851b-3c2c3ee66a12.jpg)</a>\r\n\r\n## \"Did you know\" aka \"Tip of the day\" notifications\r\n\r\nPrusaSlicer grows more powerful every day offering many unique features not found in other slicers. To streamline everyday slicing, many features are accessible through hot keys and keyboard modifiers (Ctrl / Alt + mouse key). We newly present \"Did you know\" hints inside a notification, often providing a hyper link to highlight a user interface element (toolbar button, configuration parameter) or to open a help page in web browser. The tips may be disabled in preferences, however we believe you will find them useful.\r\n\r\n![did_you_know_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/129918181-c69d6794-83f8-48de-9c3e-ae15e44b247f.png)\r\n\r\n## Upload progress\r\n\r\nMany of our users run a small or not so small print farm, thus they may use a single PrusaSlicer session to slice and upload G-codes to multiple 3D printers in succession. To better support this workflow, we implemented the following improvements:\r\n- The existing \"Print Host Upload Queue\" dialog newly supports sorting by columns and a file size column has been added.\r\n- Size and position of the \"Print Host Uplad Queue\" dialog is newly persistent.\r\n- A notification is popped up in the 3D view for each upload task initiated showing an upload progress. Thus in most cases one will not need to open the old \"Print Host Upload Queue\" dialog at all.\r\n\r\n![upload_progress_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23498906/129920034-45698b3b-fa80-4451-b218-247df47251ee.png)\r\n\r\n## Mesh simplification\r\n\r\nSometimes the model imported into PrusaSlicer is excessively detailed, slowing down speed of user interaction, slicing and producing project files (3MF/AMF) of excessive sizes. We newly provide a model simplification tool based on [Quadric Edge Collapse](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf) algorithm, thus our implementation produces similar results to Microsoft 3D Builder model simplification or to [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) Quadric Edge Collapse simplification tool. The simplification rate is controlled either by required level of detail (which internally uses estimates of maximum geometric error with respect to the original model) or by the fraction of triangles to be removed.\r\n\r\nA very high simplification rate may be used to achieve a \"Low Poly\" effect.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/131668542-4d491e37-cfef-4107-a134-b0bf254a3958.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">![upload_progress_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33929324/131668542-4d491e37-cfef-4107-a134-b0bf254a3958.jpg)</a>\r\n\r\n## Other UI improvements\r\n\r\n- Confirmation dialog on \"Delete All\" was removed, it now works the same way as if the objects were removed one by one. The confirmation dialog had its purpose until Undo / Redo was implemented [#3886](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3886).\r\n- In addition to reloading an existing object or volume geometry from disk, PrusaSlicer newly allows to replace the geometry with a different file\r\n[#3856](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3856).\r\n- PrusaSlicer newly displays the decimal separators according to user's locales, while a dot was displayed before.\r\n- \"Split to objects\" feature newly supports splitting a multi-volume object into multiple objects, while this feature used to split just a single volume into multiple objects before. If the object has multiple volumes, its volumes are assigned each to its own object. First after the object has a single volume only, \"Split to objects\" will split a volume into multiple disconnected objects if possible.\r\n- Added border to filament color in right panel combo box to improve visibility of light filaments.\r\n[#5914](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/pull/5914), thanks [@scottmudge](https://github.com/scottmudge).\r\n- Added possibility to compare configuration profiles (`Window->Compare presets`)\r\n[4cdcfe6](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/4cdcfe600598b5cb725fa346be6b7aa9e8bd7906)\r\n- Added hot keys \"1-9\" for assigning an extruder number to an object or a volume with the keyboard focus at the object list, \"0\" assigns the \"default\" extruder. Similarly, a new hotkey \"p\" toggles the \"printable\" flag of the selected objects or volumes.\r\n[#6216](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6216).\r\n- The \"Printable\" menu item is newly available for multiple object selection as well\r\n[3a53606](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/3a5360651de2b8af4a3d46b89c884222e1963f5d).\r\n- macOS specific: Enabled the platform standard \"Cmd+M\" hot key to minimize the application. The \"3DConnexion legacy set sensitivity dialog\" hot key was changed to \"Cmd+Shift+M\" on macOS.\r\n- The background of the XYZ fields in the \"Object manipulation panel\" may newly be colored with the color of the gizmo axes (red, green, blue). Configurable in Preferences by \"Use colors for axes values in Manipulation panel\", disabled by default\r\n[#4931](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4931).\r\n- Once the user paints support enforcers and supports are not enabled, a notification is newly shown suggesting to enable supports by clicking on a hyperlink\r\n[#5307](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5307).\r\n- Fixed minor text alignment issue in G-code viewer vertical scroll bar\r\n[#6182](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6182).\r\n- Multi-material specific: The \"Color Change\" dialog newly allows to generate random extruder swap sequences, producing a rainbow effect [#1866](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1866).\r\n- Settings of colors indicating the difficulty of configuration options (Simple / Advanced / Expert) was moved to Preferences to be easy to discover\r\n[#5489](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5489).\r\n- With the paint-on supports gizmo inactive, it is not clear whether an object has any supports painted. The similar applies to the painted seams, multi-material painted segmentation or variable layer height features. If any of these tools were used on an object, the fact is newly indicated at the object list by an extra line (clicking this line opens editing of the respected property, Del key can be used to remove it). Similarly it is indicated at the object list if an object is partially below the print bed (this is a new feature in PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1). In addition, we open a notification after loading a project indicating which of these features were applied to at least a single object.\r\n- Updated MK2 & MK3 textures [57a73c5](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/57a73c576933091f7c4fc0aab9f9e50fe04a05b5)\r\n- Linux specific: PrusaSlicer defines icons for many menu items, however many Linux desktops are configured so that no menu icons are shown by GTK2/GTK3 based applications, most likely because these icons are often huge. PrusaSlicer newly forces GTK2/3 to always display its tiny icons in its menus ignoring desktop defaults.\r\n\r\n## Other new features and improvements\r\n\r\n- Zipping 3MFs now uses ZIP64 format, thus our 3MFs are no more limited to 4 GB of uncompressed file and total archive size. Because Microsoft 3MF implementation does not support ZIP64, we only use the ZIP64 extension if necessary [#6193](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6193).\r\n- Windows specific, upload to print host: If the upload is secured using a self-signed SSL certificate, the Windows system often refuses the self-signed certificate because it cannot check its revocation. PrusaSlicer newly allows one to suppress the revocation check [#1781](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1781).\r\n- Linux specific, also applies to Linux on Chrome OS: Desktop integration support (conditionally compiled) allows one to install desktop integration files (PrusaSlicer.desktop, PrusaSlicer-gcodeviewer.desktop and the icons) into user's desktop. The desktop integration is offered by the installation wizard and desktop integration may also be installed / deinstalled manually from the Configuration menu. Manual desktop integration is quite useful if one experiments with multiple AppImages of different PrusaSlicer versions, the last one for which the desktop installation is performed wins [#1431](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/1431).\r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n\r\n### UI bugs fixed\r\n- OSX specific: Fixed handling of spin controls at the Purging Volumes dialog, the spin control values were sometimes not accepted [#6056](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6056).\r\n- Multi-material specific: Fixed crashing after decreasing number of printer extruders and accessing object popup menu\r\n[#6094](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6094).\r\n- Fixed inconsistency when copying an object, which is marked as not to be printed\r\n[#5619](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5619).\r\n- Linux / GTK specific: Fixed asserts emitted by the Platter preset combo boxes\r\n[#5510](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5510).\r\n- Linux / GTK specific: Fixed assert in installation wizard, on filament selection page\r\n[#5152](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5152).\r\n- Multi-material specific: After deleting all but the last volume from an object, the object's default extruder is newly initialized with the extruder of the last volume remaining. This has not been done before leading to the object being sliced with the extruder of the volume, while just the color of the object's extruder was shown in the object list.\r\n[03dee86](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/03dee860713a6161479c401cc1fc4b46ef6697c2)\r\n- Linux / GTK specific: Fixed the \"view\" combo box at the bottom of the screen, which centered the active item around the mouse cursor, thus often pushing most of the combo box items out of the screen. This is an unfortunate behavior of GTK Choice control, which we have now replaced with a Combo Box control\r\n[#6110](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6110).\r\n- Fixed installation wizard issue newly introduced in wxWidgets 3.1.4, where the spin controls to define nozzle and filament diameters did not accept commas. Worked around by replacing these spin controls with text inputs.\r\n- Linux / GTK specific: Fixed surprising opening of an edit field when one pressed a letter key with the object list focused\r\n[b87c03f](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/b87c03fc0937b27431833b4de0ebb013d9b49fa8).\r\n- Fixed a rare crash when deleting last object from plater\r\n[0c7095d](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/0c7095d807efd960fb779a26b2647ec6e1e45c02).\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed focus issue after closing a \"parameter validation error\" message box and returning the focus to the parameter page \r\n[3c37aed](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/commit/3c37aed2f8c52634fdc9e74a8f59f4cc505d8c3c).\r\n- Linux / GTK3 specific: Fixed insufficient height of combo boxes on the plater side panel\r\n[#5163](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5163)\r\n[#5505](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5505).\r\n- Fixed copy / paste of multiple objects with different attributes assigned (for example with different infill rate) leading to \"Unsupported Selection\" error\r\n[#5517](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5517).\r\n- Fixed extrusion width validation logic in case the extrusion width was specified wrt. layer height\r\n[#4631](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4631).\r\n- Fixed updates of combo boxes: Enter key did not make the combo box to accept a new value, thus the slicing back-end was not being updated \r\n[#6692](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6692).\r\n- Fixed crash when trying to open a pop-up menu of one modifier while parameters of another modifier were editable at the side panel. This was a regression since PrusaSlicer 2.3.0\r\n[#6782](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6782).\r\n- With the settings configured as floating in its own non-modal window and with the non-modal window minimized, selecting a settings page with the Ctrl-2/3/4 hot keys or from the PrusaSlicer menu did not restore the minimized window. This is now fixed\r\n[#6548](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6548).\r\n- Installing / uninstalling filaments or SLA materials using the Configuration Wizard did not work reliably\r\n[#6436](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6436).\r\n- Fixed a glitch, where editing the top solid infill type and speed was disabled in vase mode [#4241](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4241).\r\n\r\n### Presets\r\n\r\n- Fixed a loophole in PrusaSlicer, where the user was allowed to save his own profile name under the name of a system profile alias (aka symbolic name). For example, user was able to save the \"0.2mm QUALITY [@MK3](http://github.com/MK3)\" profile as \"0.2mm QUALITY\" user profile, which is the symbolic name of the system profile\r\n[#5638](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5638).\r\n- Fixed a crash when importing a config bundle as a config file. This was broken for multi-material configs with different filament profiles selected.\r\n[#5825](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5825)\r\n- Fixed reload from disk after a project is loaded from a 3MF. Reload from disk worked for a fresh project, but for a project loaded from 3MF the \"reload from disk\" feature did not reload a geometry at the same position and scale\r\n[#5541](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5541).\r\n- Reload from disk was not available for geometries imported from a 3MF or AMF format (for example if the 3MF or AMF was exported from SolidWorks) [#5071](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5071).\r\n- Fixed storing of \"pause print\" custom G-code message into a project file. The \"pause print\" message was correctly emitted into G-code for a fresh project, but not after the project was loaded from 3MF [#5888](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5888).\r\n- Fixed activation of printer specific \"default\" print / filament / sla print / sla material profiles after the first printer ever is installed by the Configuration Wizard.\r\n- Fixed storing / loading of the list of Printer profiles associated with a Physical Printer profile. Printer profile names containing semicolons or leading / trailing spaces were not handled correctly. The list of printer profiles is saved using an old \"preset_name\" config key the old unreliable way for compatibility with PrusaSlicer 2.3.3. In addition the list of profiles is stored in a robust way using a new \"preset_names\" key [#5503](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5503).\r\n- Implemented automatic conversion from meters to millimeters on loading of extremely small objects, which most likely were exported in meters. Also new menu items were added to convert from / to meters manually [#4521](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4521).\r\n- Fixed loading of project files referencing system profiles, which are not installed at the target machine. In that case the old PrusaSlicer activated some random profiles, while the new PrusaSlicer temporarily installs the missing profiles until PrusaSlicer is closed and the user is being informed with a notification.\r\n\r\n### Other bug fixes\r\n- Windows specific: Fixed \"Fix by Netfabb\" for scaled volumes, which were scaled twice after they were fixed.\r\n- Windows specific: ASUS and MSI install applications, which use libraries from [Nahimic](https://www.nahimic.com/). These Nahimic libraries are then injected into our PrusaSlicer on start-up and they lead to a crash of PrusaSlicer on start-up on some dual screen setups. We were not able to fix the issue as we were not able to get our hands on such a system, thus we implemented detection of black listed DLLs being injected into PrusaSlicer, we report them and advise to disable those services. Also the black listed DLLs injected into PrusaSlicer are being shown by the System Info dialog [#2142](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2142) [#2522](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/2522) [#3689](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3689) [#4793](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4793) [#5091](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5091) [#5573](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5573).\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed invocation of PrusaSlicer by referencing prusa-slicer binary with a $PATH variable or symlink [#5542](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5542) [#5751](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5751).\r\n- Fixed command line slicing with no printer technology (FDM or SLA) specified. Slicer should slice in FDM mode when no printer_technology is provided. This was broken between 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 (1bffc2b), where 2.3.0 sliced in SLA mode by default, but saved the output as .gcode [#5029](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5029).\r\n- Fixed crash in arrangement when the polygons to be arranged contained duplicate points [#5749](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5749).\r\n- Fixed parsing of --scale-to-fit command line parameter, reworked the scaling algorithm and placing objects to bed, which have been broken since PrusaSlicer 2.0. Also added a new command line parameter '--ensure-on-bed', which is 'true' by default: When an object is placed on the print bed, it is being aligned in Z to sit on the print bed, which corresponds to what the PrusaSlicer would do when an object is imported into the UI [#5772](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5772), [#6788](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6788).\r\n- Fixed crash when splitting models from command line using the '--split' command line parameter and empty meshes are created during the splitting [#5979](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5979) [#5991](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5991) thanks [@combolek](http://github.com/combolek).\r\n- Initialization of PrintConfig derived classes was not thread safe [#6475](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6475), thanks [@supermerill](http://github.com/supermerill) for pointing out that issue.\r\n- Fixed deadlock when canceling the slicing while gcode is creating thumbnails [#6476](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6476), thanks [@supermerill](http://github.com/supermerill) for pointing out the issue.\r\n\r\n## New 3rd party printer profiles\r\n\r\n- Added gCreate gMax printer profiles, thanks [@gordo3di](http://github.com/gordo3di)\r\n\r\n## Localization\r\n- Dictionaries for CZ, DE, ES, FR, IT and PL were updated by Prusa Research.\r\nContributors are welcome, please check the [localization guide](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/blob/master/doc/Localization_guide.md)\r\n- Korean localization update [#6314](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6314) thanks [@ulsanether](http://github.com/ulsanether).\r\n\r\n## Architecture, infrastructure\r\n\r\n- We removed libglut dependency, which is one little step forward to deprecate legacy OpenGL.\r\n- We updated ImGUI to version 1.83 to support localized decimal separator (dot versus comma).\r\n- Windows specific: Enabling /utf-8 on MSVC should fix compilation errors on Chinese Windows [#5583](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5583).\r\n- Windows specific: Visual Studio newly supports Address Sanitizer. PrusaSlicer newly supports ASAN builds on Windows using the -DSLIC3R_ASAN=on CMake switch the same way as on POSIX platforms.\r\n- We have fixed huge number of compiler warnings. We are striving to keep our builds warning free on all major platforms.\r\n- OSX specific: We increased the minimum required OSX version from 10.9 to 10.10 due to an update of wxWidgets, that does not compile on OSX 10.9.\r\n- CMakeLists was updated to require MINIMUM_BOOST_VERSION 1.66.0 due to Base64 dependency [#3375](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/3375) [#5508](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5508) thanks [@pmjdebruijn](http://github.com/pmjdebruijn).\r\n- When compiling wxWidgets as a static dependency, wxMediaCtrl support is no more compiled in as we don't need it and wxMediaCtrl requires unexpected compile dependencies on Linux [#5815](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5815) [#6160](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6160).\r\n- Linux / GTK specific: Fixed compilation against wxWidgets 3.0 [#5752](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5752) thanks [@sebastianha](http://github.com/sebastianha).\r\n- Updated boost version from 1.70.0 to 1.75.0 due to an issue with newest Xcode / clang incorrectly reporting that it supports `__cpp_lib_uncaught_exceptions` while it does not if targeting older platforms. This issue has been worked around first in boost 1.74.0.\r\n- When building static dependencies, the dependency script used to always download sources from internet. Because the Linux / Snap build system prohibits internet connection, we extended the build system to build dependencies with no internet connection by specifying a DEP_DOWNLOAD_DIR pointing to required source code packages already downloaded.\r\n- Updated the Catch2 framework from v2.13.3 to v2.13.6, fixes compilation on Fedora Rawhide [#6518](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6518) thanks [@ausil](http://github.com/ausil).\r\n- Fixed boost dependency URL as the original host's lifetime has ended [#6349](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6349) thanks [@krisrok](http://github.com/krisrok).\r\n- Some components of Thread Building Blocks (atomics, mutexes) were recently deprecated with standard library equivalents [#6590](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6590) thanks [@zavorka](http://github.com/zavorka)\r\n- Add a simple Windows command-line build script ([#6674](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/6674)) thanks [@jshuh](http://github.com/jshuh)\r\n- Linux specific: Fixed FHS install dirs [#5930](http://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/5930) thanks [@dimitry-ishenko](http://github.com/dimitry-ishenko).\r\n\r\n# This release log is clipped by github\r\n\r\nBecause the github Releases page clips the text to 25 thousand characters, full PrusaSlicer 2.4.0-alpha1 release log [is available at the wiki](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/wiki/PrusaSlicer-2.4.0-alpha1-full-change-log).\r\n",
